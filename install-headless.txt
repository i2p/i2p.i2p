Headless I2P installation instructions

1) tar xjf i2p.tar.bz2                     (you've already done this)
2) cd i2p ; vi install-headless.txt        (you're doing this now)
3) sh postinstall.sh                       (this launches the router)
4) lynx http://localhost:7657/index.jsp    (configure the router)

If you're having trouble, swing by http://forum.i2p.net/, check the
website at http://www.i2p.net/, or get on irc://irc.freenode.net/#i2p

To run I2P explicitly:
   (*nix): sh i2prouter start
   (win*): I2P.exe

To stop the router (gracefully):
   lynx http://localhost:7657/configservice.jsp ("Shutdown gracefully")

To stop the router (immediately):
   sh i2prouter stop

To uninstall I2P:
   rm -rf $i2pInstallDir
