<p>Perhaps the best introduction to Syndie can be found <a
href="threads.jsp?post=ovpBy2mpO1CQ7deYhQ1cDGAwI6pQzLbWOm1Sdd0W06c=/1132012800001">in
Syndie itself</a>.</p>

<p>Updates can be found by filtering for the <a
href="threads.jsp?tags=syndie.intro">syndie.intro</a> tag (if you only want to
receive posts that <a
href="threads.jsp?author=ovpBy2mpO1CQ7deYhQ1cDGAwI6pQzLbWOm1Sdd0W06c=">jrandom</a>
 made with that tag, that can be <a
href="threads.jsp?tags=syndie.intro&author=ovpBy2mpO1CQ7deYhQ1cDGAwI6pQzLbWOm1Sdd0W06c=">achieved</a>
as well).</p>

<p>If you have any questions or problems with Syndie, just post them and
syndicate it up to <a href="http://syndiemedia.i2p/">syndiemedia.i2p</a> (which should show up as the default archive
on new installs).  You can also use the <a href="http://forum.i2p.net/">I2P
forums</a> if you're having trouble getting Syndie to work, and people are
almost always around on the <a href="http://forum.i2p.net/viewtopic.php?t=952">#i2p irc
channel</a>.</p>

<p>One FAQ which might keep people from getting more posts into their Syndie
node regards cookies.  If you get "internal errors" when using the <a
href="syndicate.jsp">syndicate form</a>, you probably have cookies disabled. 
Syndie needs cookies to help maintain state, and while its good practice to
disable cookies in general, you should be able to tell your web browser to make
an exception and allow cookies to "localhost" (or wherever your Syndie instance
is).  Further FAQs should be found
<a href="threads.jsp?tags=syndie.faq">within syndie</a></p>
