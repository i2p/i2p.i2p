<div class='bodytext'>
Module <code >i2p.router</code > allows Python programs to control the I2P router.


<p>

<h2><a name="Functions"> Functions </a></h2>

<p>
<strong>check</strong>(dir=None)
<ul ><pre>
 Checks whether a locally installed router is running.  Does
 nothing if successful, otherwise raises i2p.RouterError.
     
 An I2P installation is located by using find(dir).
 The router.config file is parsed for 'router.adminPort'.
 This port is queried to determine whether the router is
 running.
</pre>
</ul >
<strong>find</strong>(dir=None)
<ul ><pre>

 Find the absolute path to a locally installed I2P router.
     
 An I2P installation is located by looking in the
 dir argument given to the function, then in the environment
 I2P, then in PATH.  It looks for startRouter.sh or
 startRouter.bat.  Raises ValueError if an I2P installation
 could not be located.
</pre>
</ul >
<strong>start</strong>(dir=None, hidden=False)
<ul ><pre>
 Start a locally installed I2P router.  Does nothing if
 the router has already been started.
 
 An I2P installation is located by using find(dir).
 
 If hidden is True, do not show a terminal for the router.
</pre>
</ul >
<strong>stop</strong>(dir=None, force=False)
<ul ><pre>
 Stop a locally installed I2P router, if it was started by
 the current Python program.  If force is True, stop the
 router even if it was started by another process.  Do nothing
 if force is False and the router was started by another program.
 
 The file 'router.config' is located using the same search
 process used for find(dir).  It is parsed for
 'router.shutdownPassword' and 'router.adminPort'.  The
 router is shut down through the admin port.
 
 Raises i2p.RouterError if the I2P router is running but cannot
 be stopped.  You must uncomment the
 'router.shutdownPassword' line for this command to work.
</pre>
