<p>Implements a TCP-like (reliable, authenticated, in order) set of sockets for 
communicating over the IP-like (unreliable, unauthenticated, unordered) I2P
messages.
Note that this class is split across two jars, streaming.jar and ministreaming.jar.
The interfaces and some very old code are in ministreaming.jar, but the
real work gets done in streaming.jar. Clients must have both jars
in their classpath.
Most clients will require (only) streaming.jar, ministreaming.jar, and i2p.jar
in their classpath to communicate with the router.
</p>

<p>When an application wants to use streams, it must fetch an {@link
net.i2p.client.streaming.I2PSocketManager} from the {@link 
net.i2p.client.streaming.I2PSocketManagerFactory}, which in turn builds its own
{@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession} internally.  All communication over that 
{@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession} is handled by the {@link 
net.i2p.client.streaming.I2PSocketManager}, as it imposes its own formatting on
the raw messages sent and received.  If an application wants to receive streams
from other clients on the network, it should access the blocking {@link
net.i2p.client.streaming.I2PServerSocket#accept} method, which will provide an
{@link net.i2p.client.streaming.I2PSocket} when a new one is available.  If an
application wants to create a new stream to a peer, it should do so with the
appropriate {@link net.i2p.client.streaming.I2PSocketManager#connect} call.</p>

<p>There is a simple pair of demo applications available as well -
net.i2p.client.streaming.StreamSinkServer listens to a destination and dumps 
the data from all sockets it accepts to individual files, while
net.i2p.client.streaming.StreamSinkClient connects to a particular destination
and sends a specific amount of random data then disconnects.</p>
