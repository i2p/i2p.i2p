2005-07-31  jrandom
    * Adjust the netDb search and store per peer timeouts to match the average
      measured per peer success times, rather than huge fixed values.
    * Optimized and reverified the netDb peer selection / retrieval process 
      within the kbuckets.
    * Drop TCP connections that don't have any useful activity in 10 minutes.
    * If i2np.udp.fixedPort=true, never change the externally published port,
      even if we are autodetecting the IP address.

* 2005-07-27  0.6 released

2005-07-27  jrandom
    * Enabled SSU as the default top priority transport, adjusting the 
      config.jsp page accordingly.
    * Add verification fields to the SSU and TCP connection negotiation (not
      compatible with previous builds)
    * Enable the backwards incompatible tunnel crypto change as documented in
      tunnel-alt.html (have each hop encrypt the received IV before using it,
      then encrypt it again before sending it on)
    * Disable the I2CP encryption, leaving in place the end to end garlic 
      encryption (another backwards incompatible change)
    * Adjust the protocol versions on the TCP and SSU transports so that they
      won't talk to older routers.
    * Fix up the config stats handling again
    * Fix a rare off-by-one in the SSU fragmentation
    * Reduce some unnecessary netDb resending by inluding the peers queried
      successfully in the store redundancy count.

2005-07-22  jrandom
    * Use the small thread pool for I2PTunnelHTTPServer (already used for 
      I2PTunnelServer)
    * Minor memory churn reduction in I2CP
    * Small stats update

2005-07-21  jrandom
    * Fix in the SDK for a bug which would manifest itself as misrouted
      streaming packets when a destination has many concurrent streaming
      connections (thanks duck!)
    * No more "Graceful shutdown in -18140121441141s"

2005-07-20  jrandom
    * Allow the user to specify an external port # for SSU even if the external
      host isn't specified (thanks duck!)

2005-07-19  jrandom
    * Further preparation for removing I2CP crypto
    * Added some validation to the DH key agreement (thanks $anon)
    * Validate tunnel data message expirations (though not really a problem, 
      since tunnels expire)
    * Minor PRNG threading cleanup

2005-07-15  cervantes
    * Added workaround for an odd win32 bug in the stats configuration console
      page which meant only the first checkbox selection was saved.

2005-07-15  Romster
    * Added per group selection toggles in the stats configuration console 
      page.

2005-07-13  jrandom
    * Fixed a recently injected bug in the multitransport bidding which had 
      allowed an essentially arbitrary choice of transports, rather than the
      properly ordered choice.

2005-07-13  jrandom
    * Fixed a long standing bug where we weren't properly comparing session 
      tags but instead largely depending upon comparing their hashCode, 
      causing intermittent decryption errors.

2005-07-12  jrandom
    * Add some data duplication to avoid a recently injected concurrency 
      problem in the session tag manager (thanks redzara and romster).

2005-07-11  jrandom
    * Reduced the growth factor on the slow start and congestion avoidance for
      the streaming lib.
    * Adjusted some of the I2PTunnelServer threading to use a small pool of
      handlers, rather than launching off new threads which then immediately
      launch off an I2PTunnelRunner instance (which launches 3 more threads..)
    * Don't persist session keys / session tags (not worth it, for now)
    * Added some detection and handling code for duplicate session tags being
      delivered (root cause still not addressed)
    * Make the PRNG's buffer size configurable (via the config property
      "i2p.prng.totalBufferSizeKB=4096")
    * Disable SSU flooding by default (duh)
    * Updates to the StreamSink apps for better throttling tests.

2005-07-05  jrandom
    * Use a buffered PRNG, pulling the PRNG data off a larger precalculated 
      buffer, rather than the underlying PRNG's (likely small) one, which in
      turn reduces the frequency of recalcing.
    * More tuning to reduce temporary allocation churn

2005-07-04  jrandom
    * Within the tunnel, use xor(IV, msg[0:16]) as the flag to detect dups, 
      rather than the IV by itself, preventing an attack that would let 
      colluding internal adversaries tag a message to determine that they are
      in the same tunnel.  Thanks dvorak for the catch!
    * Drop long inactive profiles on startup and shutdown
    * /configstats.jsp: web interface to pick what stats to log
    * Deliver more session tags to account for wider window sizes
    * Cache some intermediate values in our HMACSHA256 and BC's HMAC
    * Track the client send rate (stream.sendBps and client.sendBpsRaw)
    * UrlLauncher: adjust the browser selection order
    * I2PAppContext: hooks for dummy HMACSHA256 and a weak PRNG
    * StreamSinkClient: add support for sending an unlimited amount of data
    * Migrate the tests out of the default build jars

2005-06-22  Comwiz
    * Migrate the core tests to junit

2005-05-25  duck
    * Fixed PRNG bug (bugzilla #107)

2005-05-01  jrandom
    * Added a substantial optimization to the AES engine by caching the
      prepared session keys (duh).

2005-05-01  jrandom
    * Cleaned up the peers page a bit more.

2005-04-30  jrandom
    * Added a small new page to the web console (/peers.jsp) which contains 
      the peer connection information.  This will be cleaned up a lot more 
      before 0.6 is out, but its a start.

2005-04-30  jrandom
    * Reduced some SimpleTimer churn

2005-04-29  jrandom
    * Reduce the peer profile stat coallesce overhead by inlining it with the 
      reorganize.
    * Limit each transport to at most one address (any transport that requires
      multiple entry points can include those alternatives in the address).

2005-04-28  jrandom
    * More fixes for the I2PTunnel "other" interface handling (thanks nelgin!)
    * Add back the code to handle bids from multiple transports (though there
      is still only one transport enabled by default)
    * Adjust the router's queueing of outbound client messages when under 
      heavy load by running the preparatory job in the client's I2CP handler
      thread, thereby blocking additional outbound messages when the router is
      hosed.
    * No need to validate or persist a netDb entry if we already have it

2005-04-25  smeghead
    * Added button to router console for manual update checks.
    * Fixed bug in configupdate.jsp that caused the proxy port to be updated
      every time the form was submitted even if it hadn't changed.

2005-04-24  jrandom
    * Added a pool of PRNGs using a different synchronization technique, 
      hopefully sufficient to work around IBM's PRNG bugs until we get our
      own Fortuna.
    * In the streaming lib, don't jack up the RTT on NACK, and have the window
      size bound the not-yet-ready messages to the peer, not the unacked 
      message count (not sure yet whether this is worthwile).
    * Many additions to the messageHistory log.
    * Handle out of order tunnel fragment delivery (not an issue on the live 
      net with TCP, but critical with UDP).

* 2005-04-20  0.5.0.7 released

2005-04-20  jrandom
    * In the SDK, we don't actually need to block when we're sending a message
      as BestEffort (and these days, we're always sending BestEffort).
    * Pass out client messages in fewer (larger) steps.
    * Have the InNetMessagePool short circuit dispatch requests.
    * Have the message validator take into account expiration to cut down on
      false positives at high transfer rates.
    * Allow configuration of the probabalistic window size growth rate in the 
      streaming lib's slow start and congestion avoidance phases, and default 
      them to a more conservative value (2), rather than the previous value 
      (1).
    * Reduce the ack delay in the streaming lib to 500ms
    * Honor choke requests in the streaming lib (only affects those getting
      insanely high transfer rates)
    * Let the user specify an interface besides 127.0.0.1 or 0.0.0.0 on the
      I2PTunnel client page (thanks maestro^!)

2005-04-17  sirup
    * Added the possibility for i2ptunnel client and httpclient instances to 
      have their own i2p session (and hence, destination and tunnels).  By 
      default, tunnels are shared, but that can be changed on the web 
      interface or with the sharedClient config option in i2ptunnel.config.

2005-04-17  jrandom
    * Marked the net.i2p.i2ptunnel.TunnelManager as deprecated.  Anyone use
      this?  If not, I want to drop it (lots of tiny details with lots of 
      duplicated semantics).

2005-04-17  zzz
    * Added new user-editable eepproxy error page templates.

2005-04-17  jrandom
    * Revamp the tunnel building throttles, fixing a situation where the 
      rebuild may not recover, and defaulting it to unthrottled (users with
      slow CPUs may want to set "router.tunnel.shouldThrottle=true" in their
      advanced router config)

2005-04-16  jrandom
    * Migrated to Bouncycastle's SHA256 and HMAC implementations for efficiency

2005-04-12  jrandom
    * Make sure we don't get cached updates (thanks smeghead!)
    * Clear out the callback for the TestJob after it passes (only affects the
      job timing accounting)

2005-04-08  smeghead
    * Added NativeBigInteger benchmark to scripts/i2pbench.sh.

2005-04-08  smeghead
    * Security improvements to TrustedUpdate: signing and verification of the
      version string along with the data payload for signed update files
      (consequently the positions of the DSA signature and version string fields
      have been swapped in the spec for the update file's header); router will
      no longer perform a trusted update if the signed update's version is lower
      than or equal to the currently running router's version.
    * Added two new CLI commands to TrustedUpdate: showversion, verifyupdate.
    * Extended TrustedUpdate public API for use by third party applications.

* 2005-04-06  0.5.0.6 released

2005-04-05  jrandom
    * Retry I2PTunnel startup if we are unable to build a socketManager for a
      client or httpclient tunnel.
    * Add some basic sanity checking on the I2CP settings (thanks duck!)

2005-04-05  jrandom
    * After a successfull netDb search for a leaseSet, republish it to all of 
      the peers we have tried so far who did not give us the key (up to 10),
      rather than the old K closest (which may include peers who had given us
      the key)
    * Don't wait 5 minutes to publish a leaseSet (duh!), and rather than 
      republish it every 5 minutes, republish it every 3.  In addition, always
      republish as soon as the leaseSet changes (duh^2).
    * Minor fix for oddball startup race (thanks travis_bickle!)
    * Minor AES update to allow in-place decryption.

2005-04-03  jrandom
    * EepGet fix for open-ended HTTP fetches (such as the news.xml 
      feeding the NewsFetcher)

2005-04-01  jrandom
    * Allow editing I2PTunnel server instances with five digit ports 
      (thanks nickless_head!)
    * More NewsFetcher debugging for reported weirdness

2005-04-01  jrandom
    * Fix to check for missing news file (thanks smeghead!)
    * Added destination display CLI:
      java -cp lib/i2p.jar net.i2p.data.Destination privKeyFilename
    * Added destination display to the web interface (thanks pnspns)
    * Installed CIA backdoor

* 2005-03-29  0.5.0.5 released

2005-03-29  jrandom
    * Decreased the initial RTT estimate to 10s to allow more retries.
    * Increased the default netDb store replication factor from 2 to 6 to take
      into consideration tunnel failures.
    * Address some statistical anonymity attacks against the netDb that could 
      be mounted by an active internal adversary by only answering lookups for 
      leaseSets we received through an unsolicited store.
    * Don't throttle lookup responses (we throttle enough elsewhere)
    * Fix the NewsFetcher so that it doesn't incorrectly resume midway through
      the file (thanks nickster!)
    * Updated the I2PTunnel HTML (thanks postman!)
    * Added support to the I2PTunnel pages for the URL parameter "passphrase",
      which, if matched against the router.config "i2ptunnel.passphrase" value,
      skips the nonce check.  If the config prop doesn't exist or is blank, no
      passphrase is accepted.
    * Implemented HMAC-SHA256.
    * Enable the tunnel batching with a 500ms delay by default
    * Dropped compatability with 0.5.0.3 and earlier releases

2005-03-26  jrandom
    * Added some error handling and fairly safe to cache data to the streaming
      lib (good call Tom!)

2005-03-25  jrandom
    * Fixed up building dependencies for the routerconsole on some more 
      aggressive compilers (thanks polecat!)

* 2005-03-24  0.5.0.4 released

2005-03-23  jrandom
    * Added more intelligent version checking in news.xml, in case we have a 
      version newer than the one specified.

2005-03-23  jrandom
    * Added support for Transfer-Encoding: chunked to the EepGet, so that the
      cvsweb.cgi doesn't puke on us.

2005-03-23  Connelly
    * Fixed Bugzilla Bug #99 in the SAM Bridge, which caused pending
      stream send data to not be sent if STREAM CLOSE is issued too fast.

2005-03-23  jrandom
    * Implemented the news fetch / update policy code, as configurated on
      /configupdate.jsp.  Defaults are to grab the news every 24h (or if it
      doesn't exist yet, on startup).  No action is taken however, though if
      the news.xml specifies that a new release is available, an option to
      update will be shown on the router console.
    * New initialNews.xml delivered with new installs, and moved news.xml out
      of the i2pwww module and into the i2p module so that we can bundle it 
      within each update.

2005-03-23  jrandom
    * New /configupdate.jsp page for controlling the update / notification 
      process, as well as various minor related updates.  Note that not all
      options are exposed yet, and the update detection code isn't in place
      in this commit - it currently says there is always an update available.
    * New EepGet component for reliable downloading, with a CLI exposed in
      java -cp lib/i2p.jar net.i2p.util.EepGet url
    * Added a default signing key to the TrustedUpdate component to be used
      for verifying updates.  This signing key can be authenticated via
      gpg --verify i2p/core/java/src/net/i2p/crypto/TrustedUpdate.java
    * New public domain SHA1 implementation for the DSA code so that we can
      handle signing streams of arbitrary size without excess memory usage
      (thanks P.Verdy!)
    * Added some helpers to the TrustedUpdate to work off streams and to offer
      a minimal CLI: 
          TrustedUpdate keygen pubKeyFile privKeyFile
          TrustedUpdate sign origFile signedFile privKeyFile
          TrustedUpdate verify signedFile

2005-03-22  smeghead
    * New TrustedUpdate component for signing/verifying files with a DSA 
      signature.

2005-03-21  jrandom
    * Fixed the tunnel fragmentation handler to deal with multiple fragments 
      in a single message properly (rather than release the buffer into the 
      cache after processing the first one) (duh!)
    * Added the batching preprocessor which will bundle together multiple 
      small messages inside a single tunnel message by delaying their delivery 
      up to .5s, or whenever the pending data will fill a full message, 
      whichever comes first.  This is disabled at the moment, since without the
      above bugfix widely deployed, lots and lots of messages would fail.
    * Within each tunnel pool, stick with a randomly selected peer for up to
      .5s before randomizing and selecting again, instead of randomizing the
      pool each time a tunnel is needed.  

* 2005-03-18  0.5.0.3 released

2005-03-18  jrandom
    * Minor tweak to the timestamper to help reduce small skews
    * Adjust the stats published to include only the relevent ones
    * Only show the currently used speed calculation on the profile page
    * Allow the full max # resends to be sent, rather than piggybacking the
      RESET packet along side the final resend (duh)
    * Add irc.postman.i2p to the default list of IRC servers for new installs
    * Drop support for routers running 0.5 or 0.5.0.1 while maintaining 
      backwards compatability for users running 0.5.0.2.

2005-03-18  jrandom
    * Eepproxy Fix for corrupted HTTP headers (thanks nickster!)
    * Fixed case sensitivity issues on the HTTP headers (thanks duck!)

2005-03-17  jrandom
    * Update the old speed calculator and associated profile data points to 
      use a non-tiered moving average of the tunnel test time, avoiding the 
      freshness issues of the old tiered speed stats. 
    * Explicitly synchronize all of the methods on the PRNG, rather than just
      the feeder methods (sun and kaffe only need the feeder, but it seems ibm
      needs all of them synchronized).
    * Properly use the tunnel tests as part of the profile stats.
    * Don't flood the jobqueue with sequential persist profile tasks, but 
      instead, inject a brief scheduling delay between them.
    * Reduce the TCP connection establishment timeout to 20s (which is still
      absurdly excessive)
    * Reduced the max resend delay to 30s so we can get some resends in when
      dealing with client apps that hang up early (e.g. wget)
    * Added more alternative socketManager factories (good call aum!)

2005-03-16  jrandom
    * Adjust the old speed calculator to include end to end RTT data in its 
      estimates, and use that as the primary speed calculator again.
    * Use the mean of the high capacity speeds to determine the fast 
      threshold, rather than the median.  Perhaps we should use the mean of
      all active non-failing peers?
    * Updated the profile page to sort by tier, then alphabetically.
    * Added some alternative socketManager factories (good call aum!)

2005-03-14  jrandom
    * New strict speed calculator that goes off the actual number of messages
      verifiably sent through the peer by way of tunnels.  Initially, this only
      contains the successful message count on inbound tunnels, but may be 
      augmented later to include verified outbound messages, peers queried in 
      the netDb, etc.  The speed calculation decays quickly, but should give
      a better differential than the previous stat (both values are shown on 
      the /profiles.jsp page)

2005-03-11  jrandom
    * Rather than the fixed resend timeout floor (10s), use 10s+RTT as the 
      minimum (increased on resends as before, of course).
    * Always prod the clock update listeners, even if just to tell them that 
      the time hasn't changed much.
    * Added support for explicit peer selection for individual tunnel pools,
      which will be useful in debugging but not recommended for use by normal
      end users.
    * More aggressively search for the next hop's routerInfo on tunnel join.
    * Give messages received via inbound tunnels that are bound to remote
      locations sufficient time (taking into account clock skew).
    * Give alternate direct send messages sufficient time (10s min, not 5s)
    * Always give the end to end data message the explicit timeout (though the
      old default was sufficient before)
    * No need to give end to end messages an insane expiration (+2m), as we 
      are already handling skew on the receiving side.
    * Don't complain too loudly about expired TunnelCreateMessages (at least,
      not until after all those 0.5 and 0.5.0.1 users upgrade ;)
    * Properly keep the sendBps stat
    * When running the router with router.keepHistory=true, log more data to
      messageHistory.txt
    * Logging updates
    * Minor formatting updates

2005-03-08  jrandom
    * More aggressively adjust the clock

2005-03-07  jrandom
    * Fix the HTTP response header filter to allow multiple headers with the
      same name (thanks duck and spotteri!)

* 2005-03-06  0.5.0.2 released

2005-03-06  jrandom
    * Allow the I2PTunnel web interface to select streaming lib options for
      individual client tunnels, rather than sharing them across all of them,
      as we do with the session options.  This way people can (and should) set
      the irc proxy to interactive and the eepproxy to bulk.
    * Added a startRouter.sh script to new installs which simply calls 
      "sh i2prouter start".  This should make it clear how people should start
      I2P.
    * Properly expand the HTTP response header buffer (thanks shendaras!)

2005-03-04  jrandom
    * Filter HTTP response headers in the eepproxy, forcing Connection: close
      so that broken (/malicious) webservers can't allow persistent 
      connections.  All HTTP compliant browsers should now always close the 
      socket.
    * Enabled the GZIPInputStream's cache (they weren't cached before)
    * Make sure our first send is always a SYN (duh)
    * Workaround for some buggy compilers

2005-03-03  jrandom
    * Loop while starting up the I2PTunnel instances, in case the I2CP 
      listener isn't up yet (thanks detonate!)
    * Implement custom reusable GZIP streams to both reduce memory churn
      and prevent the exposure of data in the standard GZIP header (creation
      time, OS, etc).  This is RFC1952 compliant, and backwards compatible, 
      though has only been tested within the confines of I2P's compression use
      (DataHelper.[de]compress).
    * Preemptively support the next protocol version, so that after the 0.5.0.2
      release, we'll be able to drop protocol=2 to get rid of 0.5 users.

2005-03-02  jrandom
    * Fix one substantial OOM cause (session tag manager was only dropping 
      tags once the critical limit was met, rather than honoring their 
      expiration) (duh)
    * Lots of small memory fixes
    * Double the allowable concurrent outstanding tunnel build tasks (20)

2005-03-01  jrandom
    * Really disable the streaming lib packet caching
    * Synchronized a message handling point in the SDK (even though its use is
      already essentially single threaded, its better to play it safe)
    * Don't add new RepublishLeaseSetJobs on failure, just requeue up the 
      existing one (duh)
    * Throttle the number of concurrent pending tunnel builds across all 
      pools, in addition to simply throttling the number of new requests per 
      minute for each pool individually.  This should avoid the cascading 
      failure when tunnel builds take too long, as no new builds will be 
      created until the previous ones are handled.
    * Factored out and extended the DataHelper's unit tests for dealing with 
      long and date formatting.
    * Explicitly specify the HTTP auth realm as "i2prouter", though this 
      alone doesn't address the bug where jetty asks for authentication too
      much.  (thanks orion!)
    * Updated the StreamSinkServer to ignore all read bytes, rather than write
      them to the filesystem.

2005-02-27  jrandom
    * Don't rerequest leaseSets if there are already pending requests
    * Reverted the insufficiently tested caching in the DSA/SHA1 impl, and
      temporary disabled the streaming lib packet caching.
    * Reduced the resend RTT penalty to 10s

2005-02-26  jrandom
    * Force 1.3-isms on the precompiled jsps too (thanks laberhost)

2005-02-26  jrandom
    * Further streaming lib caching improvements
    * Reduce the minimum RTT (used to calculate retry timeouts), but also 
      increase the RTT on resends.
    * Lower the default message size to 4KB from 16KB to further reduce the
      chance of failed fragmentation.
    * Extend tunnel rebuild throttling to include fallback rebuilds
    * If there are less than 20 routers known, don't drop the last 20 (to help
      avoid dropping all peers under catastrophic failures)
    * New stats for end to end messages - "client.leaseSetFoundLocally",
      "client.leaseSetFoundRemoteTime", and "client.leaseSetFailedRemoteTime"

2005-02-24  jrandom
    * Throttle the number of tunnel rebuilds per minute, preventing CPU 
      overload under catastrophic failures (thanks Tracker and cervantes!)
    * Block the router startup process until we've initialized the clock

2005-02-24  jrandom
    * Cache temporary memory allocation in the DSA's SHA1 impl, and the packet
      data in the streaming lib.
    * Fixed a streaming lib bug where the connection initiator would fail the
      stream if the ACK to their SYN was lost.

2005-02-23  jrandom 
    * Now that we don't get stale SAM sessions, it'd be nice if we didn't
      get stale tunnel pools, don't you think?

* 2005-02-23  0.5.0.1 released

2005-02-22  jrandom
    * Reworked the tunnel (re)building process to remove the tokens and 
      provide cleaner controls on the tunnels built.
    * Fixed situations where the timestamper wanted to test more servers than
      were provided (thanks Tracker!)
    * Get rid of the dead SAM sessions by using the streaming lib's callbacks
      (thanks Tracker!)

2005-02-22  jrandom
    * Temporary workaround for the I2CP disconnect bug (have the streaminglib
      try to automatically reconnect on accept()/connect(..)).
    * Loop check for expired lease republishing (just in case)

2005-02-22  jrandom
    * Adjusted (and fixed...) the timestamper change detection
    * Deal with a rare reordering bug at the beginning of a stream (so we 
      don't drop it unnecessarily)
    * Cleaned up some dropped message handling in the router
    * Reduced job queue churn when dealing with a large number of tunnels by
      sharing an expiration job
    * Keep a separate list of the most recent CRIT messages (shown on the 
      logs.jsp).  This way they don't get buried among any other messages.
    * For clarity, display the tunnel variance config as "Randomization" on 
      the web console.
    * If lease republishing fails (boo! hiss!) try it again 
    * Actually fix the negative jobLag in the right place (this time)
    * Allow reseeding when there are less than 10 known peer references
    * Lots of logging updates.

2005-02-20  jrandom
    * Allow the streaming lib resend frequency to drop down to 20s as the
      minimum, so that up to 2 retries can get sent on an http request.
    * Add further limits to failsafe tunnels.
    * Keep exploratory and client tunnel testing and building stats separate.
    * Only use the 60s period for throttling tunnel requests due to transient
      network overload.
    * Rebuild tunnels earlier (1-3m before expiration, by default)
    * Cache the next hop's routerInfo for participating tunnels so that the
      tunnel participation doesn't depend on the netDb.
    * Fixed a long standing bug in the streaming lib where we wouldn't always
      unchoke messages when the window size grows.
    * Make sure the window size never reaches 0 (duh)

2005-02-20  jrandom
    * Only build failsafe tunnels if we need them
    * Properly implement the selectNotFailingPeers so that we get a random
      selection of peers, rather than using the strictOrdering (thanks dm!)
    * Don't include too many "don't tell me about" peer references in the 
      lookup message - only send the 10 peer references closest to the target.

2005-02-19  jrandom
    * Only build new extra tunnels on failure if we don't have enough
    * Fix a fencepost in the tunnel building so that e.g. a variance of
      2 means +/- 2, not +/- 1 (thanks dm!)
    * Avoid an NPE on client disconnect
    * Never select a shitlisted peer to participate in a tunnel
    * Have netDb store messages timeout after 10s, not the full 60s (duh)
    * Keep session tags around for a little longer, just in case (grr)
    * Cleaned up some closing event issues on the streaming lib
    * Stop bundling the jetty 5.1.2 and updated wrapper.config in the update
      so that 0.4.* users will need to do a clean install, but we don't need 
      to shove an additional 2MB in each update to those already on 0.5.
    * Imported the susimail css (oops, thanks susi!)

* 2005-02-18  0.5 released

2005-02-17  jrandom
    * If the clock is adjusted during a job run, don't act as if the job took
      negative time.

2005-02-17  jrandom
    * Included the GPL'ed susimail 0.13 by default (thanks susi23!)

2005-02-17  jrandom
    * Fixed the braindead tunnel testing logic
    * If a large number of tunnels are failing (within the last 5-10 minutes)
      and the current tunnel pool's configuration allows it, randomly build a 
      zero hop tunnel to replace failed tunnels.
    * Enable postman's POP3 and SMTP tunnels by default

2005-02-16  jrandom
    * Added some error handling when the number of session tags exceeds the
      realistic capacity, dropping a random chunk of received tag sets and
      conducting some minor analysis of the remaining ones.  This is a part
      of a pretty serious error condition, and logs as CRIT (if/when people 
      see "TOO MANY SESSION TAGS!", please let me know the full log line it
      puts in the wrapper.log or /logs.jsp)
    * Update the addressbook to only write to the published hosts location
      if the addressbook's config contains "should_publish=true" (by default,
      it contains "should_publish=false")

2005-02-16  jrandom
    * (Merged the 0.5-pre branch back into CVS HEAD)
    * Replaced the old tunnel routing crypto with the one specified in
      router/doc/tunnel-alt.html, including updates to the web console to view
      and tweak it.  
    * Provide the means for routers to reject tunnel requests with a wider 
      range of responses:
        probabalistic rejection, due to approaching overload
        transient rejection, due to temporary overload
        bandwidth rejection, due to persistent bandwidth overload
        critical rejection, due to general router fault (or imminent shutdown)
      The different responses are factored into the profiles accordingly.
    * Replaced the old I2CP tunnel related options (tunnels.depthInbound, etc)
      with a series of new properties, relevent to the new tunnel routing code:
        inbound.nickname (used on the console)
        inbound.quantity (# of tunnels to use in any leaseSets)
        inbound.backupQuantity (# of tunnels to keep in the ready)
        inbound.length (# of remote peers in the tunnel)
        inbound.lengthVariance (if > 0, permute the length by adding a random # 
                                up to the variance.  if < 0, permute the length
                                by adding or subtracting a random # up to the 
                                variance)
        outbound.* (same as the inbound, except for the, uh, outbound tunnels
                    in that client's pool)
      There are other options, and more will be added later, but the above are
      the most relevent ones.
    * Replaced Jetty 4.2.21 with Jetty 5.1.2
    * Compress all profile data on disk.
    * Adjust the reseeding functionality to work even when the JVM's http proxy
      is set.
    * Enable a poor-man's interactive-flow in the streaming lib by choking the
      max window size.
    * Reduced the default streaming lib max message size to 16KB (though still
      configurable by the user), also doubling the default maximum window 
      size.
    * Replaced the RouterIdentity in a Lease with its SHA256 hash.
    * Reduced the overall I2NP message checksum from a full 32 byte SHA256 to
      the first byte of the SHA256.
    * Added a new "netId" flag to let routers drop references to other routers
      who we won't be able to talk to.
    * Extended the timestamper to get a second (or third) opinion whenever it 
      wants to actually adjust the clock offset.
    * Replaced that kludge of a timestamp I2NP message with a full blown 
      DateMessage.
    * Substantial memory optimizations within the router and the SDK to reduce
      GC churn.  Client apps and the streaming libs have not been tuned, 
      however.
    * More bugfixes than you can shake a stick at.

2005-02-13  jrandom
    * Updated jbigi source to handle 64bit CPUs.  The bundled jbigi.jar still 
      only contains 32bit versions, so build your own, placing libjbigi.so in 
      your install dir if necessary.  (thanks mule!)
    * Added support for libjbigi-$os-athlon64 to NativeBigInteger and CPUID
      (thanks spaetz!)

2005-02-10  smeghead
    * Initial check-in of Pants, a new utility to help us manage our 3rd-party
      dependencies (Fortuna, Jetty, Java Service Wrapper, etc.). Some parts of
      Pants are still non-functional at this time so don't mess with it yet
      unless you want to potentially mangle your working copy of CVS.

2005-02-09  duck
    * Allow an unneeded newline in the SAM client connection without
      disconnecting.

2005-02-07  jrandom
    * Fixed a race in the streaming lib's delayed flush algorithm (thanks anon!)

2005-02-06  Sugadude
    * Added a filter to the addressbook to remove entries that dont end in ".i2p"

2005-02-03  smeghead
    * Added Ant buildfile in apps/fortuna for creating a custom Fortuna PRNG jar
      library from GNU Crypto's CVS HEAD sources.

2005-01-26  smeghead
    * i2pProxy.pac, i2pbench.sh, and i2ptest.sh are now shipped with the dist
      packages and installed to $i2pinstalldir/scripts.
    * Added command line params to i2ptest.sh and i2pbench.sh: --gij to run them
      using gij + libgcj, and --sourcedir to run them from the source tree
      instead of the installation directory.
    * Fixed unreachable for() statement clause in the KBucketImpl class that was
      causing gcj to toss a compilation warning (jrandom++).

2005-01-26  smeghead
    * Added a couple of scripts, i2ptest.sh and i2pbench.sh, to manage the core
      tests and benchmarks.
    * Routerconsole now builds under gcj 3.4.3.
    * Corrected divide by zero error in TunnelId class under gcj (jrandom++).

2005-01-25  smeghead
    * Tweaked some classes to enable gcj 3.4.3 to compile the router and
      supporting apps (except for the routerconsole which is still being
      investigated).

2005-01-24  smeghead
    * C#-ification of sam-sharp: interface greatly simplified using delegates
      and events; SamBaseEventHandler provides basic implementation and helper
      methods but is now optional.
    * NAnt buildfile and README added for sam-sharp.

2005-01-23  smeghead
    * Port the java SAM client library to mono/C# and released into the 
      public domain.  The 0.1 version of this port is available in CVS as
      i2p/apps/sam/csharp/src/I2P.SAM.Client.  The other nonfunctional C#
      library has been removed.

2005-01-21  Jhor
    * Updated jbigi build scripts for OSX.

2005-01-21  jrandom
    * Added support for OSX to the NativeBigInteger code so that it will look
      in the classpath for libjbigi-osx-none.jnilib.  At the moment, that file
      is not bundled with the shipped jbigi.jar yet though.

2005-01-18  jrandom
    * Increased the max # session tags maintained and decreased slightly the
      period over which they are gathered.

2005-01-17  jrandom
    * Added meaningful support for adjusting the preferred message size in the
      streaming lib by setting the i2p.streaming.maxMessageSize=32768 (or 
      whatever).  The other side will mimic a reduction (but never an increase).
    * Always make sure to use distinct ConnectionOption objects for each 
      connection (duh)
    * Reduced the default ACK delay to 500ms on in the streaming lib
    * Only shrink the streaming window once per window
    * Don't bundle a new jetty.xml with updates
    * Catch another local routerInfo corruption issue on startup.

2005-01-15  cervantes
    * Added support to the eepproxy for URLs such as 
      http://localhost:4444/eepproxy/foo.i2p/bar/baz or even
      http://localhost:4444/eepproxy/foo.i2p/?i2paddresshelper=base64

2005-01-15  jrandom
    * Caught a series of (previously unhandled) errors caused by requeueing 
      messages that had timed out on the TCP transport (thanks mae^!)
    * Reduce the barrier to dropping session tags on streaming lib resends -
      every fourth send should drop the tags, forcing ElGamal encryption.  This
      will help speed up the recovery after a disconnect, rather than the drop
      every fifth send.

* 2005-01-06  0.4.2.6 released

2005-01-06  jrandom
    * Added a startup message to the addressbook, printing its version number
      to stdout (which is sent to wrapper.config) when it loads.
    * Updated the addressbook to reread the config file periodically
    * Added orion.i2p to the list of eepsites on the default homepage

2005-01-05  jrandom
    * Handle unexpected network read errors more carefully (thanks parg!)
    * Added more methods to partially compare (DataHelper) and display 
      arrays (Base64.encode).
    * Exposed the AES encryptBlock/decryptBlock on the context.aes()
    * Be more generous on the throttle when just starting up the router
    * Fix a missing scheduled event in the streaming lib (caused after reset)
    * Add a new DisconnectListener on the I2PSocketManager to allow 
      notification of session destruction.
    * Make sure our own router identity is valid, and if it isn't, build a new
      one and restart the router.  Alternately, you can run the Router with 
      the single command line argument "rebuild" and it will do the same.

2004-12-31  ragnarok
    * Integrated latest addressbook changes (2.0.3) which include support for 
      deploying as a .war file with no existing addressbook configuration.
    * Updated main build process to bundle the addressbook.war in the 
      i2pinstall.jar and i2pupdate.zip.

2004-12-31  jrandom
    * Speling fxi (thanks digum!)
    * Bugfix for the I2PTunnel web interface so that it now properly launches
      newly added tunnels that are defined to be run on startup (thanks ugha!)

2004-12-30  jrandom
    * Revised the I2PTunnel client and httpclient connection establishment 
      throttles.  There is now a pool of threads that build the I2PSocket
      connections with a default size of 5, configurable via the I2PTunnel 
      client option 'i2ptunnel.numConnectionBuilders' (if set to 0, it will
      not throttle the number of concurrent builders, but will launch a thread
      per socket during establishment).  In addition, sockets accepted but
      not yet allocated to one of the connection builders will be destroyed
      after 30 seconds, configurable via 'i2ptunnel.maxWaitTime' (if set to
      0, it will wait indefinitely).

2004-12-29  jrandom
    * Imported Ragnarok's addressbook source (2.0.2) which is built but not
      deployed in the i2pinstall.jar/i2pupdate.zip (yet).
    * Don't treat connection inactivity closure as a connection error.

2004-12-29  jrandom
    * Add in a new keepalive event on each TCP connection, proactively sending
      a (tiny) time message every minute or two, as well as killing the 
      connection if no message has been fully sent within 5 minutes or so.  
      This should help deal with hung connections from IP address changes.

2004-12-28  jrandom
    * Cleaned up the resending and choking algorithm in the streaming lib.
    * Removed the read timeout override for I2PTunnel's httpclient, allowing
      it to use the default for the streaming lib.
    * Revised ack triggers in the streaming lib.
    * Logging.

* 2004-12-21  0.4.2.5 released

2004-12-21  jrandom
    * Track a new stat for expired client leases (client.leaseSetExpired).

2004-12-21  jrandom
    * Cleaned up the postinstall/startup scripts a bit more to handle winME,
      and added windows info to the headless docs. (thanks ardvark!)
    * Fixed a harmless (yet NPE inspiring) race during the final shutdown of 
      a stream (thanks frosk!)
    * Add a pair of new stats for monitoring tunnel participation - 
      tunnel.participatingBytesProcessed (total # bytes transferred) and
      tunnel.participatingBytesProcessedActive (total # bytes transferred for
      tunnels whose byte count exceed the 10m average).  This should help 
      further monitor congestion issues.
    * Made the NamingService factory property public (thanks susi!)

2004-12-20  jrandom
    * No longer do a blocking DNS lookup within the jobqueue (thanks mule!)
    * Set a 60s dns cache TTL, instead of 0s.  Most users who used to use
      dyndns/etc now just use IP autodetection, so the old "we need ttl=0"
      reasoning is gone.

2004-12-19  jrandom
    * Fix for a race on startup wrt the new stats (thanks susi!)

2004-12-19  jrandom
    * Added three new stats - router.activePeers, router.fastPeers, and 
      router.highCapacityPeers, updated every minute

2004-12-19  jrandom
    * Added a new i2ptunnel type: 'httpserver', allowing you to specify what
      hostname should be sent to the webserver.  By default, new installs will
      have an httpserver pointing at their jetty instance with the spoofed 
      name 'mysite.i2p' (editable on the /i2ptunnel/edit.jsp page).

2004-12-19  scintilla
    * Convert native jcpuid code from C++ to C. This should alleviate build
      problems experienced by some users.

* 2004-12-18  0.4.2.4 released

2004-12-16  jrandom
    * Catch another oddball case for a reset connection in the streaming lib.
    * Add a dumpprofile.jsp page, called with ?peer=base64OfPeerHash, which
      dumps the current state of that peer's profile.  Instead of the full 
      base64, you can pass in however many characters you have and it will
      return the first match found.

2004-12-16  jrandom
    * Remove the randomized factor in the tunnel rejection by bandwidth -
      we now accept the request if we've allocated less than our limit
      and reject it if we've allocated more.
    * Stick to the standard capacity scale on tunnel rejection, even for 
      the 10m period.
    * Build the time message at the very last possible moment

2004-12-15  jrandom
    * Handle hard disconnects more gracefully within the streaming lib, and
      log unmonitored events more aggressively.
    * If we drop a peer after connection due to clock skew, log it to the
      /logs.jsp#connectionlogs with relevent info.  In addition, toss it in
      the stat 'tcp.disconnectAfterSkew'.
    * Fixed the formatting in the skew display
    * Added an ERROR message that is fired once after we run out of 
      routerInfo files (thanks susi!)
    * Set the connect timeout equal to the streaming lib's disconnect timeout
      if not already specified (the I2PTunnel httpclient already enforces a
      60s connect timeout)
    * Fix for another connection startup problem in the streaming lib.
    * Fix for a stupid error in the probabalistic drop (rand <= P, not > P)
    * Adjust the capacity calculations so that tunnel failures alone in the 
      last 10m will not trigger a 0 capacity rank.

2004-12-14  jrandom
    * Periodically send a message along all I2NP connections with the router's
      current time, allowing the receiving peer to determine that the clock 
      has skewed too much, and hence, disconnect.  For backwards compatability
      reasons, this is being kludged into a DeliveryStatusMessage (ewww).  The
      next time we have a backwards compatability break, we can put in a proper
      message setup for it.

2004-12-14  jrandom
    * Reenable the probabalistic drop on the TCP queues to deal with good old
      fashioned bandwidth limiting.  However, by default the probability is
      rigged to reserve 0% of the queue free - meaning we just aggressively
      fail messages in the queue if we're transferring too slowly.  That
      reservation factor can be increased with 'tcp.queueFreeFactor=0.25'
      (or whatever) and the drop code can be disabled with the parameter
      'tcp.dropProbabalistically=false'.
    * Still penalize a peer on tunnel failure, but don't immediately drop 
      their capacity to 0.
    * More aggressively ACK duplicates
    * Randomize the timestamper period
    * Display the clock skew on the connection logs when a peer sends it.
    * Allow the timestamper to fix skews of up to 10 minutes
    * Logging

2004-12-13  jrandom
    * Added some error checking on the new client send job (thanks duck!)
    * Implemented tunnel rejection based on bandwidth usage (rejecting tunnels
      proportional to the bytes allocated in existing tunnels vs the bytes 
      allowed through the bandwidth limiter).
    * Enable a new configuration parameter for triggering a tunnel rebuild 
      (tunnel.maxTunnelFailures), where that is the max allowed test failures
      before killing the tunnel (default 0).
    * Gather more data that we rank capacity by (now we monitor and balance the
      data from 10m/30m/60m/1d instead of just 10m/60m/1d).
    * Fix a truncation/type conversion problem on the long term capacity 
      values (we were ignoring the daily stats outright)

2004-12-11  jrandom
    * Fix the missing HTTP timeout, which was caused by the deferred syn used
      by default.  This, in turn, meant the I2PSocket creation doesn't fail
      on .connect, but is unable to transfer any data in any direction.  We now
      detect that condition for the I2PTunnelHTTPClient and throw up the right
      error page.
    * Logging

2004-12-11  jrandom
    * Use a simpler and less memory intensive job for processing outbound 
      client messages when the session is in mode=bestEffort.  We can 
      immediately discard the data as soon as its sent the first time, 
      rather than wait for an ack, since we will never internally resend.
    * Reduce some synchronization to avoid a rare deadlock
    * Replaced 'localhost' with 127.0.0.1 in the i2ptunnel config, and special
      case it within the tunnel controller.
    * Script cleanup for building jbigi/jcpuid
    * Logging

* 2004-12-08  0.4.2.3 released

2004-12-08  jrandom
    * Revised the buffering when reading from the SAM client and writing 
      to the stream.  Also added a thread (sigh) so we don't block the
      SAM client from giving us more messages for abnormally long periods
      of time.
    * Display the router version in the logs on startup (oft requested)
    * Fix a race during the closing of a messageOutputStream

2004-12-06  jrandom
    * Don't do a 'passive flush' while there are already outbound messages 
      unacked.
    * Show the reseed link if up to 10 peers profiles are active (thanks 
      dburton!)

2004-12-06  jrandom
    * Don't propogate streaming connection failures out to the SAM bridge as
      fatal errors.
    * Dont barf on repeated I2CP closure.

2004-12-05  jrandom
    * Explicitly use "127.0.0.1" to bind the I2CP listener, not the JVM's
      getLocalhost call

2004-12-05  jrandom
    * Default the I2CP listener to localhost only, unless overridden by 
      i2cp.tcp.bindAllInterfaces=true (thanks dm!)
    * More SAM fixes for things recently broken (whee)

2004-12-05  jrandom
    * Fix the recently broken SAM bridge (duh)
    * Add a new pair of SAM apps - net.i2p.sam.client.SAMStreamSink and
      net.i2p.sam.client.SAMStreamSend, mirroring the streaming lib's
      StreamSink and StreamSend apps for transferring files.
    * Make the passive flush timer fire more frequently.

2004-12-05  jrandom
    * Fixed some links in the console (thanks ugha!) and the javadoc 
      (thanks dinoman!)
    * Fix the stream's passive flush timer (oh, its supposed to work?)

2004-12-03  jrandom
    * Toss in a small pool of threads (3) to execute the events queued up with
      the SimpleTimer, as we do currently see the occational event 
      notification spiking up to a second or so.
    * Implement a SAM client API in java, useful for event based streaming (or
      for testing the SAM bridge)
    * Added support to shut down the SAM bridge on OOM (useful if the SAM 
      bridge is being run outside of the router).
    * Include the SAM test code in the sam.jar
    * Remove an irrelevent warning message from SAM, which was caused by 
      perfectly normal operation due to a session being closed.
    * Removed some unnecessary synchronization in the streaming lib's 
      PacketQueue
    * More quickly clean up the memory used by the streaming lib by 
      immediately killing each packet's resend job as soon as it is ACKed (or
      cancelled), so that there are no longer any valid pointers to the 
      (potentially 32KB) packet.
    * Fixed the timestamps dumped to stdout when debugging the PacketHandler.
    * Drop packets that would expand our inbound window beyond our maximum 
      buffer size (default 32 messages)
    * Always read the ACK/NACK data from the verified packets received, even
      if we are going to drop them
    * Always adjust the window when there are messages ACKed, though do not
      change its size except as before.
    * Streamlined some synchronization in the router's I2CP handling
    * Streamlined some memory allocation in the SAM bridge
    * Default the streaming lib to disconnect on inactivity, rather than send
      an empty message.

2004-12-01  jrandom
    * Fix for a race in the streaming lib as caused by some odd SAM activity

* 2004-12-01  0.4.2.2 released

2004-12-01  jrandom
    * Fixed a stupid typo that inadvertantly allowed persistent HTTP 
      connections to work (thanks duck!)
    * Make sure we override the inactivity timeout too

* 2004-12-01  0.4.2.1 released

2004-12-01  jrandom
    * Strip out any of the Accept-* HTTP header lines, and always make sure to
      include the forged User-agent header.
    * Adjust the default read timeout on the eepproxy to 60s, unless 
      overridden.
    * Minor tweak on stream shutdown.

2004-11-30  jrandom
    * Render the burst rate fields on /config.jsp properly (thanks ugha!)
    * Build in a simple timeout to flush data queued into the I2PSocket but
      not yet flushed.
    * Don't explicitly flush after each SAM stream write, but leave it up to 
      the [nonblocking] passive flush.
    * Don't whine about 10-99 connection events occurring in a second
    * Don't wait for completion of packets that will not be ACKed (duh)
    * Adjust the congestion window, even if the packet was resent (duh)
    * Make sure to wake up any blocking read()'s when the MessageInputStream
      is close()ed (duh)
    * Never wait more than the disconnect timeout for a write to complete

2004-11-29  jrandom
    * Minor fixes to avoid unnecessary errors on shutdown (thanks susi!)

2004-11-29  jrandom
    * Reduced contention for local client delivery
    * Drop the new code that munges the wrapper.config.  Instead, updates that
      need to change it will include their own wrapper.config in the 
      i2pupdate.zip, overwriting the existing file.  If the file 
      "wrapper.config.updated" is included, it is deleted at first opportunity
      and the router shut down, displaying a notice that the router must be 
      started again cleanly to allow the changes to the wrapper.config to take
      effect.
    * Properly stop accept()ing I2PSocket connections if we close down the 
      session (duh).
    * Make sure we cancel any outstanding Packets in flight when a connection
      is terminated (thanks susi!)
    * Split up the I2PTunnel closing a little further.

2004-11-28  jrandom
    * Accept IP address detection changes with a 2-out-of-3 minimum.
    * As long as the router is up, keep retrying to bind the I2CP listener.
    * Decrease the java service wrapper ping frequency to once every 10 
      minutes, rather than once every 5 seconds.

2004-11-27  jrandom
    * Some cleanup and bugfixes for the IP address detection code where we 
      only consider connections that have actually sent and received messages
      recently as active, rather than the mere presence of a TCP socket as 
      activity.

2004-11-27  jrandom
    * Removed the I2PTunnel inactivity timeout thread, since the new streaming
      lib can do that (without an additional per-connection thread).
    * Close the I2PTunnel forwarder threads more aggressively

2004-11-27  jrandom
    * Fix for a fast loop caused by a race in the new streaming library (thanks
      DrWoo, frontier, pwk_, and thetower!)
    * Minor updates to the SimpleTimer and Connection to help track down a
      high CPU usage problem (dumping debug info to stdout/wrapper.log if too
      many events/tasks fire in a second)
    * Minor fixes for races on client disconnects (causing NPEs)

* 2004-11-26  0.4.2 released

2004-11-26  jrandom
    * Enable the new streaming lib as the default.  That means, for any 
      substantial definition, it is NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE.  

2004-11-25  jrandom
    * Revised the installer to include start menu and desktop shortcuts for
      windows platforms, including pretty icons (thanks DrWoo!)
    * Allow clients specified in clients.config to have an explicit startup
      delay.
    * Update the default install to launch a browser pointing at the console
      whenever I2P starts up, rather than only the first time it starts up
      (configurable on /configservice.jsp, or in clients.config)
    * Bugfix to the clock skew checking code to monitor the delta between
      offsets, not the offset itself (duh)
    * Router console html update
    * New (and uuuuugly) code to verify that the wrapper.config contains 
      the necessary classpath entries on update.  If it has to update the
      wrapper.config, it will stop the JVM and service completely, since the
      java service wrapper doesn't reread the wrapper.config on JVM restart -
      requiring the user to manually restart the service after an update.
    * Increase the TCP connection timeout to 30s (which is obscenely long)

2004-11-22  jrandom
    * Update to the SAM bridge to reduce some unnecessary memory allocation.
    * New stat to keep track of slow jobs (ones that take more than a second
      to excute).  This is published in the netDb as jobQueue.jobRunSlow

2004-11-21  jrandom
    * Update the I2PTunnel web interface to include an option for the new 
      streaming lib (which is ignored until the 0.4.2 release).
    * Revised the I2PTunnel web interface to keep the I2CP options of client 
      and httpclient tunnels in sync, as they all share the same I2CP session.

2004-11-21  jrandom
    * Only allow small clock skews after the first 10 minutes of operation
      (to prevent later network lag bouncing us way off course - yes, we
      really need an NTP impl to balance out the network burps...)
    * Revamp the I2PTunnel web interface startup process so that everything
      is shown immediately, so that different pieces hanging don't hang
      the rest, and other minor bugfixes.
    * Take note of SAM startup error (in case you're already running a SAM
      bridge...)
    * Increase the bandwidth limiter burst values available to 10-60s (or
      whatever is placed in /configadvanced.jsp, of course)

2004-11-21  jrandom
    * Allow end of line comments in the hosts.txt and other config files,
      using '#' to begin the comments (thanks susi!)
    * Add support to I2PTunnel's 'client' feature for picking between multiple
      target destinations (e.g. 'client 6668 irc.duck.i2p,irc.baffled.i2p')
    * Add a quick link on the left hand nav to reseed if there aren't enough
      known peers, as well as link to the config page if there are no active 
      peers.  Revised config page accordingly.

2004-11-21  jrandom
    * Destroy ElGamal/AES+SessionTag keys after 15 minutes of inactivity 
      rather that every 15 minutes, and increase the warning period in which
      we refresh tags from 30s to 2 minutes.
    * Bugfix for a rare problem closing an I2PTunnel stream where we'd fail
      to close the I2PSocket (leaving it to timeout).

2004-11-19  jrandom
    * Off-by-one fix to the tunnel pool management code, along side some 
      explicit initialization.  This can affect clients whose lengths are
      shorter than the router's default (thanks duck!)

2004-11-17  jrandom
    * Fix to propogate i2psocket options into the SAM bridge correctly (thanks
      Ragnarok!)

2004-11-17  jrandom
    * Minor logging update.

2004-11-16  jrandom
    * Clean up the propogation of i2psocket options so that various streaming
      libs can honor them more precisely

2004-11-16  jrandom
    * Minor logging update

2004-11-14  jrandom
    * Fix a long standing leak in I2PTunnel (hanging on to i2psocket objects)
    * Fix a leak injected into the SimpleTimer
    * Fix a race condition in the tunnel message handling

2004-11-13  jrandom
    * Added throttles on how many I2PTunnel client connections we open at once
    * Replaced some buffered streams in I2PTunnel with unbuffered streams, as 
      the streaming library used should take care of any buffering.
    * Added a cache for some objects used in I2PTunnel, especially useful when
      there are many short lived connections.
    * Trimmed the SimpleTimer's processing a bit

2004-11-10  jrandom
    * Allow loading the (mini)streaming connection options from the 
      environment.
    * More defensive programming in the DSA implementation.

2004-11-08  jrandom
    * Remove spurious flush calls from I2PTunnel, and work with the 
      I2PSocket's output stream directly (as the various implementations
      do their own buffering).
    * Another pass at a long standing JobQueue bug - dramatically simplify
      the job management synchronization since we dont need to deal with
      high contention (unlike last year when we had dozens of queue runners
      going at once).
    * Logging

2004-11-08  jrandom
    * Make the SAM bridge more resiliant to bad handshakes (thanks duck!)

* 2004-11-06  0.4.1.4 released

2004-11-06  jrandom
    * Expose a drop down on the /configclients.jsp to enter the outbound 
      tunnel depth.
    * Improved *hosts.txt loading
    * Explicitly override the JVM's timezone settings to use GMT so that 
      any client applications which use timezones won't leak sensitive
      data (thanks gott!)
    * Bundle sam.jar in the update (thanks duck!)

2004-11-06  jrandom
    * Fix for a long standing synchronization bug in the SDK that in rare 
      instances can add a few seconds of lag.

2004-11-05  jrandom
    * Bugfixes and unit tests for the SAM bridge to handle quoted message
      parameters, verify proper operation after multiple session lifetimes,
      as well as some synchronization problems.
    * New properties method on the DataHelper class.
    * Address a race on fast disconnecting clients

2004-11-02  jrandom
    * Fix for a long standing synchronization bug in the JobQueue (and added
      some kooky flags to make sure it stays dead)
    * Update the ministreaming lib to force mode=guaranteed if the default
      lib is used, and mode=best_effort for all other libs.

2004-11-02  jrandom
    * Fixed up the configuration overrides for the streaming socket lib 
      integration so that it properly honors env settings.
    * More memory usage streamlining (last major revamp for now, i promise)

2004-11-01  jrandom
    * Increase the tunnel test timeout rapidly if our tunnels are failing.
    * Honor message expirations for some tunnel jobs that were prematurely
      expired.
    * Streamline memory usage with temporary object caches and more efficient
      serialization for SHA256 calculation, logging, and both I2CP and I2NP
      message handling.
    * Fix some situations where we forward messages too eagerly.  For a 
      request at the tunnel endpoint, if the tunnel is inbound and the target 
      is remote, honor the message by tunnel routing the data rather than
      sending it directly to the requested location.

2004-10-30  jrandom
    * Cache the temporary objects used in the AES encryption/decryption
      process so that AES doesn't require any memory allocation to process
      data.
    * Dramatically reduce memory usage within various crypto implementations
      by avoiding unnecessary (though simplifying) buffers.
    * If we specify some tags to be sent in an I2CP message explicitly, use
      only those, not those plus a new set (otherwise we aren't sure on ACK
      which set was delivered)
    * Allow configuration for the partial send timeout (how long before 
      resending a message down a different tunnel in a lease).  This can be
      updated with the "router.clientPartialSendTimeout" router config prop.
    * Logging

2004-10-29  jrandom
    * Strip the Referer, Via, and From headers completely, rather than 
      inserting a bogus value ("i2p").  This should help with the use of
      SnipSnap and Geeklog (thanks nickster and DrWoo!)

2004-10-27  jrandom
    * Fix a strange race condition on i2cp client disconnect.
    * win98 startup fixes (thanks tester-1 and ardvark!)
    * include build scripts for the new streaming lib (which is NOT ready
      for use yet, but you can hack around with it)

2004-10-24  jrandom
    * Allow explicit inclusion of session tags in the SDK, enabling the
      resending of tags bundled with messages that would not otherwise
      be ACKed.
    * Don't force mode=guaranteed for end to end delivery - if mode=bestEffort
      no DeliveryStatusMessage will be bundled (and as such, client apps using
      it will need to do their own session tag ack/nack).
    * Handle client errors when notifying them of message availability.
    * New StreamSinkSend which sends a file to a destination and disconnects.
    * Update the I2PSocketManagerFactory to build the specific 
      I2PSocketManager instance based on the "i2p.streaming.manager" property,
      containing the class name of the I2PSocketManager to instantiate.

2004-10-23  jrandom
    * Minor ministreaming lib refactoring to simplify integration of the full
      streaming lib.
    * Minor bugfixes to data structure serialization.

* 2004-10-18  0.4.1.3 released

2004-10-18  jrandom
    * Allow sending messages with a section of a byte array.
    * Reduced stats published.

2004-10-17  jrandom
    * Don't b0rk on whitespace in the router address.

2004-10-16  jrandom
    * More aggressively reduce the capacity of peers if their tunnels are
      failing so that we move off them quicker.
    * Simplify some data structure serialization for reuse in the streaming
      lib, as well as add support for signing and verifying partial byte 
      arrays.
    * Logging updates

2004-10-16  jrandom
    * Increased the default minimum tunnel test time to 5 seconds, since we
      still see the occational message processing time spike to 2 seconds.
    * Update the SimpleTimer to allow rescheduling a task thats already 
      queued (useful for the new streaming lib).

2004-10-15  jrandom
    * Replaced old minimum tunnel test timeout of 1s with a configurable
      value (router.config property "router.tunnelTestMinimum", with the
      default of 2s).

2004-10-14  jrandom
    * Tunnel rejection is no longer a sign of an overwhelmingly loaded
      peer, so don't use it as a key point of the IsFailing calculator.
      We still use it as a key point of the Capacity calculator, however.

2004-10-14  jrandom
    * Allow for a configurable tunnel "growth factor", rather than trying
      to achieve a steady state.  This will let us grow gradually when
      the router is needed more, rather than blindly accepting the request
      or arbitrarily choking it at an averaged value.  Configure this with
      "router.tunnelGrowthFactor" in the router.config (default "1.5").
    * Adjust the tunnel test timeouts dynamically - rather than the old
      flat 30s (!!!) timeout, we set the timeout to 2x the average tunnel
      test time (the deviation factor can be adjusted by setting 
      "router.tunnelTestDeviation" to "3.0" or whatever).  This should help
      find the 'good' tunnels.
    * Added some crazy debugging to try and track down an intermittent hang.

2004-10-13  jrandom
    * Fix the probabalistic tunnel reject (we always accepted everything, 
      since the docs on java.util.Random.nextDouble() are wrong..)
    * Fixed a race on startup (thanks Quadn!)

2004-10-12  jrandom
    * Disable the probabalistic drop by default (enable via the router config
      property "tcp.dropProbabalistically=true")
    * Disable the actual watchdog shutdown by default, but keep track of more 
      variables and log a lot more when it occurs (enable via the router 
      config property "watchdog.haltOnHang=true")
    * Implement some tunnel participation smoothing by refusing requests 
      probabalistically as our participating tunnel count exceeds the previous
      hour's, or when the 10 minute average tunnel test time exceeds the 60 
      minute average tunnel test time.  The probabilities in both cases are 
      oldAverage / #current, so if you're suddenly flooded with 200 tunnels
      and you had previously only participated in 50, you'll have a 25% chance
      of accepting a subsequent request.

* 2004-10-10  0.4.1.2 released

2004-10-10  cervantes
    * Update the I2PTunnel HTTP proxy to strip out the i2paddresshelper from
      the request.

2004-10-09  jrandom
    * Added a watchdog timer to do some baseline liveliness checking to help 
      debug some odd errors.
    * Added a pair of summary stats for bandwidth usage, allowing easy export
      with the other stats ("bw.sendBps" and "bw.receiveBps")
    * Trimmed another memory allocation on message reception.

2004-10-08  jrandom
    * Revamp the AESInputStream so it doesn't allocate any temporary objects 
      during its operation.

2004-10-08  jrandom
    * Don't kill the establisher threads during a soft restart.
    * Attempt to validate the peer's routerInfo earlier during handshaking.
    * Revamp the AESOutputStream so it doesn't allocate any temporary objects 
      during its operation.

2004-10-07  jrandom
    * Reimplement the I2NP reading with less temporary memory allocation.
      There is still significant GC churn, especially under load, but this
      should help.
    * Catch some oddball errors in the transport (message timeout while 
      establishing).

2004-10-07  jrandom
    * Expire queued messages even when the writer is blocked.
    * Reimplement most of the I2NP writing with less temporary memory 
      allocations (I2NP reading still gobbles memory).

2004-10-06  jrandom
    * Implement an active queue management scheme on the TCP transports,
      dropping messages probabalistically as the queue fills up.  The 
      estimated queue capacity is determined by the rate at which messages 
      have been sent to the peer (averaged at 1, 5, and 60m periods).  As 
      we exceed 1/2 of the estimated capacity, we drop messages throughout
      the queue probabalistically with regards to their size.  This is based
      on RFC 2309's RED, with the minimum threshold set to 1/2 the 
      estimated connection capacity.  We may want to consider using a send
      rate and queue size measured across all connections, to deal with our
      own local bandwidth saturation, but we'll try the per-con metrics first.

2004-10-06  jrandom
    * Enable explicit disabling of the systray entirely for windows machines
      with strange configurations: add -Dsystray.disable=true to the java 
      command line.  (thanks mihi!)

2004-10-05  jrandom
    * Allow peers on the same LAN to communicate with each other safely even
      when they cannot talk to each other through the external address.

2004-10-05  jrandom
    * Display how much time is left before the graceful shutdown is complete.
    * Debug some improperly failed messages on timeout or disconnection.

2004-10-05  jrandom
    * Don't go into a fast busy if an I2PTunnel 'server' is explicitly killed
      (thanks mule!)
    * Handle some more error conditions regarding abruptly closing sockets 
      (thanks Jonva!)

2004-10-04  jrandom
    * Update the shitlist to reject a peer for an exponentially increasing 
      period of time (with an upper bounds of an hour).  
    * Various minor stat and debugging fixes

2004-10-03  jrandom
    * Add a new stat logging component to optionally dump the raw stats to 
      disk as they are generated, rather than rely upon the summarized data.
      By default, this is off, but the router property "stat.logFilters" can
      be set to a comma delimited list of stats (e.g. "client.sendAckTime")
      which will be written to the file "stats.log" (or whatever the property
      "stat.logFile" is set to).  This can also log profile related stats,
      such as "dbResponseTime" or "tunnelTestResponseTime".

2004-10-02  jrandom
    * Assure that we quickly fail messages bound for shitlisted peers.
    * Address a race on startup where the first peer contacted could hang the
      router (thanks Romster!)
    * Only whine about an intermittent inability to query the time server once

2004-10-02  jrandom
    * Command line utility to verify a peer's reachability - simply run
      net.i2p.router.transport.tcp.ConnectionHandler hostname port# and it
      will print out whether that peer is reachable or not (using a simple
      verification handshake).

* 2004-10-01  0.4.1.1 released

2004-10-01  jrandom
    * Handle partial reseeds, caused by seeds going away before the download
      completes (thanks Sugadude!)

2004-10-01  jrandom
    * Explicitly refuse IPv6 addresses, since only some peers support 
      them and we want fully reachable peers.

2004-10-01  jrandom
    * Additional error handling for a variety of transport layer errors.

* 2004-09-30  0.4.1 released (not backwards compatible)

2004-09-30  jrandom
    * Bundle the configuration necessary to run an eepsite out of the box
      with Jetty - simply edit ./eepsite/docroot/index.html and give people
      the key listed on the I2PTunnel configuration page, and its up.
    * Router console cleanup, and some (off by default) tunnels - 
      smtp.postman.i2p (port 7659), pop.postman.i2p (port 7660), and
      irc.baffled.i2p (port 7661)

2004-09-29  jrandom
    * Always wipe the Jetty work directory on startup, so that web updates
      are reflected immediately (Jetty does not honor the cache across
      multiple executions)

2004-09-27  jrandom
    * Limit the number of connection tags saved to 10,000.  This is a huge 
      limit, but consumes no more than 1MB of RAM.  For now, we drop them 
      randomly after reaching that size, forcing those dropped peers to use
      a full DH negotiation.
    * HTML cleanup in the console.

2004-09-26  jrandom
    * Complete rewrite of the TCP transport with IP autodetection and 
      low CPU overhead reconnections.  More concise connectivity errors
      are listed on the /oldconsole.jsp as well.  The IP autodetection works
      by listening to the first person who tells you what your IP address is
      when you have not defined one yourself and you have no other TCP 
      connections.
    * Update to the I2NP message format to add transparent verification at
      the I2NP level (beyond standard TCP verification).
    * Remove a potential weakness in our AESEngine's safeEncrypt and safeDecrypt
      implementation (rather than verifying with E(H(key)), we now verify with
      E(H(iv))).
    * The above changes are NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE.
    * Removed all of the old unused PHTTP code.
    * Refactor various methods and clean up some javadoc.

2004-09-21  jrandom
    * Have two tiers of hosts.txt files - the standard "hosts.txt" and
      the new "userhosts.txt".  Updates to I2P will only overwrite the former,
      but values stored in the later take precedence.  Both are queried on
      lookup.

2004-09-16  jrandom
    * Refactor the TCP transport to deal with changing identities gracefully,
      and to prevent some wasted effort by keeping track of what host+port
      combinations we are connected to (rather than just the identities).  Also
      catch a few configuration errors earlier.
    * Removed no longer relevent methods from the Transport API that were 
      exposing ideas that probably shouldn't be exposed.
    * Removed the 0.4.0.1 specific files from i2pupdate.zip (relating to script
      updates)

2004-09-13  jrandom
    * Update for the SDK reconnection to deal with overflow.
    * Web improvements (@ not # on the /logs.jsp [thanks ugha!] and fixed the 
      rounding on lifetime bandwidth used [thanks gott!]).

* 2004-09-08  0.4.0.1 released

2004-09-08  jrandom
    * Updated the "Active:" peer count to display the # of connections as well
      as the number of recently active router identities.
    * Implement some basic updating code - on startup, if there is a file named 
      "i2pupdate.zip" in the I2P installation directory, extract it, delete it,
      then restart.
    * Added an ugly little script to allow launching the router on win9x 
      machines without a dos box (using javaw to run a .bat file).
    * Logging updates.
    * Updated VERSION constants to 0.4.0.1

2004-09-08  hypercubus
    * Bugfix: Running the installer as a non-privileged user on Red Hat (and
      hopefully any other affected *nix systems) now properly discards non-
      essential directories after installation.
    * Support for Win9x in the installer and postinstall.bat.
    * Changed the name of the default installation directory on all platforms
      from "I2P" to "i2p" in the installer.
    * Changed "wrapper.conf" to "wrapper.config" for naming consistency with the
      other configuration files.

2004-09-07  cervantes:
    * Proxy recursion disabled by default (strict)
    * Password Authentication for session commands
    * Support for http://path?i2paddresshelper=BASE64
    * Support for http://i2p/BASE64/path syntax

2004-09-07  jrandom
    * Make sure that peers placed in the 'fast' group are ones we both know
      how to reach and have been able to reach recently.  These peers may 
      still be placed in the 'high capacity' group however (though that group
      is only queried if the 'fast' group is too small)
    * Include some updates to the ProgileOrganizer's CLI.

2004-09-07  jrandom
    * Disable the timestamper by default for all applications except the router
      (enable via -Dtime.disabled=false)
    * Simplify the retrieval of the full destination with text based browsers.
    * Bundle the updated wrapper.config and hosts.txt in the i2pupdate.tar.bz2

2004-09-07  jrandom
    * Write the native libraries to the current directory when they are loaded 
      from a resource, and load them from that file on subsequent runs (in 
      turn, we no longer *cough* delete the running libraries...)
    * Added support for a graceful restart.
    * Added new pseudo-shutdown hook specific to the router, allowing 
      applications to request tasks to be run when the router shuts down.  We
      use this for integration with the service manager, since otherwise a 
      graceful shutdown would cause a timeout, followed by a forced hard 
      shutdown.
    * Made the capacity calculator a bit more dynamic by not outright ignoring
      the otherwise valid capacity data for a period with a single rejected
      tunnel (except for the 10 minute period).  In addition, peers with an
      equal capacity are ordered by speed rather than by their hashes.
    * Cleaned up the SimpleTimer, addressing some threading and synchronization
      issues.
    * When an I2PTunnel client or httpclient is explicitly closed, destroy the
      associated session (unless there are other clients using it), and deal
      with a closed session when starting a new I2PTunnel instance.
    * Refactoring and logging.

2004-09-06  jrandom
    * Address a race condition in the key management code that would manifest
      itself as a corrupt router identity.
    * Properly clear old transport addresses from being displayed on the old
      console after soft restarts.
    * Properly refuse to load the client applications more than once in the 
      same JVM.
    * Added support for a graceful restart (a graceful shutdown followed by a
      full JVM restart - useful for restarting client apps).
    * More defensive programming, HTML cleanup, logging
    * wrapper.config cleanup of duplicate lines

2004-09-04  jrandom
    * Added some basic guards to prevent multiple instances from running.
      Specifically, a file "router.ping" in the install directory which is
      written to once a minute - if that file exists and has been modified
      within the last minute, refuse to start up.  In turn, adjust the 
      service wrapper to wait a minute before restarting a crashed JVM.
    * Create a "work" directory in the I2P install dir which Jetty will
      use for all of its temporary files.
    * Tell the browser not to cache most of the router console's pages.

2004-09-04  jrandom
    * Update the SDK to automatically reconnect indefinitely with an 
      exponential delay on retries (capped at 5 minutes).

* 2004-09-03  0.4 released

2004-09-03  jrandom
    * Updated default wrapper.config to deal with the hard restart option
    * Include the history.txt in the /help.jsp page
    * HTML updates (wrapper.log, and no more unix scripts)
    * Updated VERSION constants to 0.4

2004-09-03  hypercubus
    * Bugfix: Installer launches postinstall.bat on WinNT/2K properly.
    * Temporarily removed install_i2p_service_unix and
      uninstall_i2p_service_unix from distribution packages.
    * postinstall.bat/postinstall.sh cleans installation directory of all files
      not applicable to the host OS.

2004-09-03  oOo
    * Added some filters to the HTTP request, replacing the User-Agent,
      Referrer, Via, and From headers, which helps until we have a more 
      comprehensive filtering system.

2004-09-03  jrandom
    * Disabled the old listener on port 7655.

2004-09-02  jrandom
    * Cleaned up the base build.xml, adding a new target ("updater") which 
      builds the file i2pupdate.tar.bz2 which can be safely extracted over 
      existing installs.

2004-xx-xx  jrandom
    * Implemented the new web architecture and router console
    * Implemented I2PTunnel web interface, and revamped startup process.
    * Revamped peer selection code to address skew.
    * Removed all temporary threads from the router and the SDK.
    * Bugfix dealing with timeouts and resends.
    * Integrated Iakin's jcpuid library and jbigi update, with modifications.

2004-xx-xx  hypercubus
    * Implemented the new installation process.
    * Integrated systray 
    * Integrated service manager

2004-xx-xx  oOo
    * Implemented ?i2paddresshelper= hook 
    * Many small bugfixes to the web interface, router, i2ptunnel, and core.

2004-xx-xx  Nightblade
    * libSAM updates.

2004-xx-xx  cervantes
    * Imported i2pProxy.pac proxy script in with the build.
