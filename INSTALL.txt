I2P source installation instructions

Prerequisites to build from source:
	Java SDK (preferably Oracle or OpenJDK) 17 or higher
          Non-linux operating systems and JVMs: See https://trac.i2p2.de/wiki/java
          Certain subsystems for embedded (core, router, mstreaming, streaming, i2ptunnel) require only Java 1.6
	Apache Ant 1.9.8 or higher
	The xgettext, msgfmt, and msgmerge tools installed
	  from the GNU gettext package http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/
	Build environment must use a UTF-8 locale.

To build and install I2P from source, you must first build
and package up the appropriate installer by running:

  	ant pkg

On non-x86, use one of the following instead:
	ant installer-linux
	ant installer-freebsd
	ant installer-osx



This will produce a few key files:
* install.jar:    the GUI and console installer
* i2pinstall.exe: the GUI and console installer wrapped for cross-platform execution
                  (only created with ant pkg)
* i2pupdate.zip:  the update package
                  (only created with ant pkg)

From there, you can run the headless (console mode) installer:
  java -jar i2pinstall.exe -console
or
  java -jar i2pinstall.jar -console

Or run the GUI installer:
  java -jar i2pinstall.exe
or
  java -jar i2pinstall.jar
or on Windows, just double-click on i2pinstall.exe.

Or move the i2pupdate.zip file into an existing installation directory and restart.

To start I2P:
   (*nix, BSD, Mac): sh i2prouter start
   (win*): I2P.exe or i2prouter.bat
   (platforms without wrapper support): sh runplain.sh

To install I2P as a system service:
   (*nix, BSD, Mac) sh i2prouter install
   (win*) install_i2p_service_winnt.bat

To uninstall I2P as a system service:
   (*nix, BSD, Mac) sh i2prouter remove
   (win*) uninstall_i2p-service_winnt.bat

To stop I2P (gracefully):
   lynx http://localhost:7657/summaryframe (click "Shutdown")
   or (*nix, BSD, Mac) sh i2prouter graceful

To stop I2P immediately:
   (*nix, BSD, Mac) sh i2prouter stop

To uninstall I2P:
   rm -rf $I2PInstallDir ~/.i2p
