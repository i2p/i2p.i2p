# Blocking is now enabled by default.
# To disable blocking, set router.blocklist.enable=false on configadvanced.jsp and restart.
#
# Add additional entries as desired, sorting not required.
# This file is only read at router startup.
# To manually block a router after startup, use the form on http://localhost:7657/configpeer.jsp
# Warning - a large list will increase memory usage.
# Please do not block too broadly, it will segment and harm the network.
# For example, http://www.bluetack.co.uk/config/splist.zip is very broad and includes Tor users, it is not recommended.
# A more reasonable list: http://www.bluetack.co.uk/config/level1.zip
#
# You may also wish to add the bogons from http://www.cymru.com/Documents/bogon-list.html ,
# but you will have to update your blocklist manually as IP ranges are assigned.
# You must update this list yourself, it is not overwritten by the update process.
