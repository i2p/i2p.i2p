<ul class="links"><li class="tidylist"><b>Starting Up&hellip;</b><br>If you've just started I2P, the number of <i>Active Peers</i> indicated under the <i>Peers Section</i> in the lefthand sidepanel should start to grow over the next few minutes and you'll also see a <i>Local Destination</i> named <i>Shared Clients</i> listed there, and possibly other clients and servers depending on how I2P is configured 
   (if not, see the troubleshooting section <a href="#trouble">below</a>). These <i>Local Destinations</i> provide connections on different ports (and sometimes protocols) to the I2P network enabling your bittorrent, e-mail, web proxy and other services to function.</li> 

<li class="tidylist"><b>Network integration</b><br> The first time you start I2P it may take a few minutes to bootstrap (integrate) you into the network and find additional peers to optimize your integration, so please be patient. Once green stars are indicated next to your <i>Local Destinations</i>, there is a wide variety of things you can do with I2P, and below we introduce you to some of them.</ul>
  
<h3>Services on I2P</h3>
<ul class="links">

      <li class="tidylist"><b>Anonymous E-mail</b><br>Postman's I2P-based mail system can be accessed either via <a href="/susimail/">I2P's built-in webmail</a> (aka susimail) or using any mail client that supports smtp and pop3. Accounts can send and receive mail from the normal internet. For an account, visit <a href="http://hq.postman.i2p/" target="_blank">hq.postman.i2p</a>. Additionally, <a href="http://i2pbote.i2p/" target="_blank">I2P-Bote</a> is a new serverless, end-to-end encrypted e-mail system (with web interface) developed by HungryHobo, installable as a <a href="#plugins">plugin</a>.</li>

<li class="tidylist"<b>Invisible Internet & Public Web Browsing</b><br>On I2P you can access anonymous websites (aka eepsites) and other services (eg. ssh over I2p, your own IRC server etc) in addition to being able to host your own services, and you can also access the normal web anonymously via I2P. <a href="http://www.i2p2.de/htproxyports.html" target="_blank">Configure your browser</a> to use the HTTP  <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Proxy_server " target="_blank">proxy</a> I2P provides at <code>127.0.0.1 port 4444</code>, then browse to an eepsite or a normal <code>http://</code> address. <a href="#eepsites">Below</a> we list some of the sites hosted on I2P.</li>

<li class="tidylist"><b>Anonymous File Transfer</b><br><a href="/i2psnark" target="_blank">I2PSnark</a> is integrated into I2P, providing anonymous, encrypted <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/BitTorrent_(protocol)" target="_blank">BitTorrent</a> transfers. In addition, Sponge develops a bittorrent client called <a href="http://bob.i2p/Robert.html">Robert</a> written in Python. There is also a port of <a href="http://www.emule-project.net/" target="_blank">eMule</a> to I2P called <a href="http://echelon.i2p/imule">iMule</a> [Needs developers!], an anonymous, secure implementation of a <a href="https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Gnutella" target="_blank">Gnutella network</a>, accessible using <a href="http://echelon.i2p/i2phex/" target="_blank">I2Phex</a>, and additional facilities including browser-based file hosting etc.</li>
      <li class="tidylist"><b>Anonymous Chat</b><br>Start your IRC client (eg. chatzilla, pidgin, x-chat)
        and connect to the <a href="irc://127.0.0.1:6668/i2p">server</a> at <code>127.0.0.1 port 6668</code>. Your local I2P IRC proxy on <code>localhost:6668</code> will direct you to one of two IRC servers hosted on I2P by Postman and Badger, but neither you nor they know where the other is, and your mom, ISP or government is unable to intercept your conversation! Once you're there, <code>#i2p</code>, <code>#i2p-help</code>, <code>#i2p-chat</code> and <code>#i2p-dev</code> are just a few of the available channels you may wish to /join. There's also a I2P based <a href=http://echelon.i2p/qti2pmessenger>instant messenger</a> for unmonitorable, uncensorable, anonymous chat.</li>
      <li class="tidylist"><b>Forums & Blogging</b><br><a href="http://syndie.i2p2.de/" target="_blank">Syndie</a> is a distributed forum and blogging platform for I2P [Needs developers!]. There's also an I2P plugin port of the Java-based <a href="http://pebble.sourceforge.net/" target="_blank">pebble</a> blogging platform ported to I2P by zzz, available on <a href="http://i2plugins.i2p" target="_blank">i2plugins.i2p</a>. And of course all normal blogging, forum and cms software will run over I2P, though you're advised to take extra precautions with security when setting up and keep all associated software (eg. Php, MySql, Python, Apache etc) up to date and locked down! Also, there are quite a few forums running on I2P in various languages; see <a href="#eepsites">below</a> for some suggestions.</li>
      <a name="plugins"></a><li class="tidylist"><b>Plugins for I2P</b><br>Extend the usefulness of I2P by installing plugins&hellip; blogging, chatting, filesharing and other plugins have already been written or ported and await your <a href="http://i2plugins.i2p/plugins/" target="_blank">installation</a>! Browse the plugins and related info at <a href="http://i2plugins.i2p" target="_blank">i2plugins.i2p</a>.

<h3>Anonymous Encrypted Webserving on I2P</h3>
<ul class="links">

<li class="tidylist"><b>Ready to roll!</b><br>I2P comes built-in with a ready-to-go webserver for hosting your own anonymous website (eepsite) on the I2P network: a <a href="http://jetty.mortbay.org/" target="_blank">Jetty</a> instance listening on <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7658/" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:7658/</a>. To host your own content
  simply place your files in the <code>eepsite/docroot/</code> directory (or place 
  any standard JSP/Servlet .war files under <code>eepsite/webapps</code>, 
  or standard CGI script under <code>eepsite/cgi-bin</code>) and they'll show 
  up. You can also run any alternative webserver platform over I2P and replace the built-in server, or run it on another tunnel.</li>
      <li class="tidylist"><b>Start your tunnel</b><br>  
  After starting up your pre-configured <a href="/i2ptunnel/" target="_blank">I2P Webserver tunnel</a>,  
your eepsite will be visible (but not discoverable) to others. Detailed instructions for starting 
  your eepsite, registering an .i2p domain and promoting your site to others are accessible via your own I2P websever on <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7658/help/" target="_blank">http://127.0.0.1:7658/help/</a>.</li></ul>

<h2>Troubleshooting &amp; Further Assistance</h2><a name="trouble"></a>
    <ul class="links">
      <li class="tidylist"><b>Be patient!</b><br>I2P may be slow to start the first time as it searches for peers. 
  If, after 30 minutes, your Active: connected/recent count has less than 10 connected 
  peers, you should open <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/config">I2P's port</a> on your modem, router and/or firewall(s) for better connectivity. More information on how to go about port forwarding can be found at <a href="http://portforward.com" target="_blank">portforward.com</a>, in addition to our forums and IRC channels listed below.</li> 
  <li class="tidylist"><b>Check your proxy setttings</b><br>If 
  you cannot see any eepsites at all (even <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/" target="_blank">www.i2p2.i2p</a>), 
  be sure your browser proxy is set to access http traffic (<i>not</i> https, <i>not</i> socks) via <code>127.0.0.1 port 4444</code>. If you need some help, there's <a href="http://www.i2p2.i2p/htproxyports.html" target="_blank">a guide</a> to configuring your browser for I2P use, also <a href="http://www.i2p2.de/htproxyports.html" target="_blank">available</a> on the normal net. </li>
  
  <li class="tidylist"><b>Getting support online</b><br>You may also want
