Release checklist
-----------------

One week before:
	Make announcement on Transifex with checkin deadline


A day or two before:
Write the release announcement and push to Transifex:
	Checkout i2p.newsxml branch
	See README for setup
	./create_new_entry.sh
	tx push -s
	mtn ci

	Checkout i2p.www branch
	Write draft release announcement - see i2p2www/blog/README for instructions
		Top content should be the same as the news entry
	Push blog strings (including draft announcement) to Transifex

	Make announcement on Transifex asking for news translation


Ensure all translation updates are imported from Transifex
Sync with mtn.i2p2.i2p
Start with a clean checkout mtn -d i2p.mtn co --branch=i2p.i2p /path/to/releasedir
You may build with Java 7 or higher, but ensure you have the Java 6 JRE installed for the bootclasspath

Create override.properties with (adjust as necessary):
-----------
release.privkey.su3=/path/to/su3keystore.ks
release.gpg.keyid=0xnnnnnnnn
release.signer.su3=xxx@mail.i2p
build.built-by=xxx
javac.compilerargs=-bootclasspath /usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/rt.jar:/usr/lib/jvm/java-6-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/jce.jar
-----------

Copy latest trust list _MTN/monotonerc from website or some other workspace

Change revision in:
	history.txt
	installer/install.xml
	core/java/src/net/i2p/CoreVersion.java
	router/java/src/net/i2p/router/RouterVersion.java
		(change to BUILD = 0 and EXTRA = "")

mtn ci

Review the complete diff from the last release:
        mtn diff -r t:i2p-0.9.(xx-1) > out.diff
        vi out.diff

Verify that no untrusted revisions were inadvertently
blessed by a trusted party:
        mtn log --brief --no-graph --to t:i2p-0.9.(xx-1) | cut -d ' ' -f 2 | sort | uniq -c

=========================================
NOTE: These tasks are now automated by 'ant release'

Build and tag:
	ant pkg

Create signed update files with:
	export I2P=~/i2p
	java -cp $I2P/lib/i2p.jar net.i2p.crypto.TrustedUpdate sign i2pupdate.zip i2pupdate.sud /path/to/private.key 0.x.xx
	java -cp $I2P/lib/i2p.jar net.i2p.crypto.TrustedUpdate sign i2pupdate200.zip i2pupdate.su2 /path/to/private.key 0.x.xx

Verify signed update files with:
	java -cp $I2P/lib/i2p.jar net.i2p.crypto.TrustedUpdate showversion i2pupdate.sud
	java -cp $I2P/lib/i2p.jar net.i2p.crypto.TrustedUpdate verifysig i2pupdate.sud

Make the source tarball:
	Start with a clean checkout mtn -d i2p.mtn co --branch=i2p.i2p i2p-0.x.xx
        Double-check trust list
	tar cjf i2psource-0.x.xx.tar.bz2 --exclude i2p-0.x.xx/_MTN i2p-0.x.xx	
	mv i2p-0.x.xx.tar.bz2 i2p.i2p

Rename some files:
	mv i2pinstall.exe i2pinstall-0.x.xx.exe
	mv i2pupdate.zip i2pupdate-0.x.xx.zip

Generate hashes:
	sha256sum i2p*0.x.xx.*
	sha256sum i2pupdate.sud
	sha256sum i2pupdate.su2

Generate PGP signatures:
	gpg -b i2pinstall-0.x xx.exe
	gpg -b i2psource-0.x.xx.tar.bz2
	gpg -b i2pupdate-0.x.xx.zip
	gpg -b i2pupdate.sud
	gpg -b i2pupdate.su2

(end of tasks automated by 'ant release')
=========================================

Now test:
- Save the output about checksums, sizes, and torrents to a file (traditionally shasums.txt)
  (edit timestamps to UTC if you care)
- Copy all the release files somewhere, make sure you have the same ones as last release
- Verify sha256sums for release files
- Check file sizes vs. previous release, shouldn't be smaller
  (this one will be about 1MB bigger for the updaters due to geoip inclusion)
- Unzip or list files from i2pupdate.zip, see if it looks right
- For either windows or linux installer:
  (probably should do both the first time)
   - Rename any existing config dir (e.g. mv .i2p .i2p-save)
   - Run installer, install to temp dir
   - Look in temp dir, see if all the files are there
   - Unplug ethernet / turn off wifi so RI doesn't leak
   - i2prouter start
   - Verify release number in console
   - Verify welcome news
   - Click through all the app, status, eepsite, and config pages, see if they look right
   - Click through each of the translations, see if /console looks right
   - Look for errors in /log (other than can't reseed errors)
   - Look in config dir, see if all the files are there
   - Shutdown
   - Delete config dir
   - Move saved config dir back
   - Reconnect ethernet / turn wifi back on
- Load torrents in i2psnark on your production router, verify infohashes

If all goes well:
	mtn tag h: i2p-0.x.xx
	mtn cert t:i2p-0.x.xx branch i2p.i2p.release
	mtn sync (with e.g. mtn.killyourtv.i2p)

Add magnet links, change release dates and release number in to old-format news.xml,
and distribute to news hosts
In the i2p.newsxml branch, edit magnet links, release dates and release number in data/releases.json, and check in

Add update torrents to tracker2.postman.i2p and start seeding (su2 and su3)

Notify the following people:
	All in-network update hosts
	PPA maintainer
	news.xml maintainer
	backup news.xml maintainer
	website files maintainer

Update Trac:
	Add milestone and version dates
	Increment milestone and version defaults

Wait for website files to be updated

Website files to change:
	Sync with mtn.i2p-projekt.i2p
	hosts.txt if it changed (copy from i2p.i2p mtn branch)
	i2p2www/__init__.py (release number)
	i2p2www/pages/downloads/macros (checksums)
	i2p2www/static/news/news.xml
	Sync with mtn.i2p-projekt.i2p

Wait for a few update hosts to be ready
Tell news hosts to flip the switch
Wait for debian packages to be ready

Announce on:
         #i2p, #i2p-dev (also on freenode side)
         forum.i2p
         twitter
