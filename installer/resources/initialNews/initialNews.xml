<h3>Congratulations on getting I2P installed!</h3>
<p>
<b>Welcome to I2P!</b>
Please <b>have patience</b> as I2P boots up and finds peers.

<p>
While you are waiting, please <b>adjust your bandwidth settings</b> on the
<a href="config.jsp">configuration page</a>.

<p>
Also you can setup your browser to use the I2P proxy to reach eepsites. Just enter 127.0.0.1 (or localhost)
port 4444 as a http proxy into your browser settings. Do not use SOCKS for this. More information
can be found on <a href="https://www.i2p2.de/htproxyports.html">I2P browser proxy setup page.</a>.
