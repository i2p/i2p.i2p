 <h1>Welcome to your eepsite</h1>
<p>(<a href="index_de.html">Deutsch</a>)</p>
 <p>This is your eepsite - simply edit the files under ./eepsite/docroot/ 
 and they'll be reachable by others once you follow the instructions below.
 In I2P, eepsites are addressed using a 'key', which is represented as a really long Base64 string.
 (The 'key' is somewhat analogous to an IP address, and
 is shown on the eepsite's I2PTunnel
 <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/i2ptunnel/edit.jsp?tunnel=3">configuration page</a>).
 The instructions below detail how to assign a name like "mysite.i2p" to your key and
 start up your eepsite.</p>
 <p>You can reach your eepsite locally through 
 <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7658/">http://127.0.0.1:7658/</a>.

 <h2>Step-by-step instructions for starting your new eepsite and announcing it to the I2P community</h2>
 Your eepsite is stopped by default.
 After you start it, it will be difficult for other people to find because it
 doesn't have a name and they don't have your really long Base64 key.
 You could just tell people that really long key, but thankfully i2p has an address book
 and several easy ways to tell people about your eepsite. Here's detailed instructions.
 <ul>
 <li>Pick a name for your eepsite (<i>something</i>.i2p). Use all lower-case.
     You may wish to check first in your own router's address book
     <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/susidns/addressbook.jsp?book=router&filter=none">here</a>,
     or the file i2p/hosts.txt to see if your name is already taken.
     Enter the new name for your eepsite on the
     <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/i2ptunnel/edit.jsp?tunnel=3">eepsite i2ptunnel configuration page</a>
     where it says "Website name". This will replace the default "mysite.i2p".
     Also, check the "Auto Start" box. Your eepsite will now start every time you start your router.
     Be sure and click "Save".
 <li>Click the start button for your eepsite on the
     <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/i2ptunnel/index.jsp">main i2ptunnel configuration page</a>.
     You should now see "eepsite" listed under "Local Destinations" on the left side of the
     <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/index.jsp">I2P Router Console</a>.
     Your eepsite is now running.
 <li>Highlight the entire "Local destination" key on the
     <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/i2ptunnel/edit.jsp?tunnel=3">eepsite i2ptunnel configuration page</a>.
     and copy it for
     later pasting. Make sure you get the whole thing - it's over 500 characters and it must end in "AAAA".
 <li>Enter the name and paste in the destination key into your
     <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/susidns/addressbook.jsp?book=master">master address book</a>.
     Click "Add" to add the destination to your address book.
 <li>In your browser, enter in your eepsite name (<i>something</i>.i2p) and you should
     be right back here. Hopefully it worked.
 <li>Before you tell the world about your new eepsite, you should add some content.
     Go to i2p/eepsite/docroot and copy this document (index.html) to help.html so you can refer to it later.
     Now edit index.html and add content, pictures, and whatever you would like to share.
 <li>Now it's time to add your eepsite to an I2P address book hosted by a site
     such as <a href="http://stats.i2p/">stats.i2p</a>.
     That is, you must enter
     your eepsite name and key into a web interface on one or more of these sites.
     Here is <a href="http://stats.i2p/i2p/addkey.html">the key entry form at stats.i2p</a>.
     Again, your key is the entire "Local destination" key on the
     <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/i2ptunnel/edit.jsp?tunnel=3">eepsite i2ptunnel configuration page</a>.
     Be sure you get the whole thing, ending with "AAAA".
     Don't forget to click "add a key".
     Check to see if it reports the key was added.
     Since many routers periodically get address book updates from these sites, within several hours others will be able to find your
     website by simply typing <i>something</i>.i2p into their browser.
 <li>Speaking of address book updates, this would be a good time to add some more addressbooks
     to your own subscription list. Go to your <a href="http://127.0.0.1:7657/susidns/subscriptions.jsp">subscriptions configuration page</a>
     and add a couple of these -
     <a href="http://tino.i2p/hosts.txt">http://tino.i2p/hosts.txt</a>,
     <a href="http://stats.i2p/cgi-bin/newhosts.txt">http://stats.i2p/cgi-bin/newhosts.txt</a>,
     <a href="http://i2host.i2p/cgi-bin/i2hostetag">http://i2host.i2p/cgi-bin/i2hostetag</a>,
     and hit "Save".
     Now you will get updates too!
 <li>If you are in a hurry and can't wait a few hours, you can tell people to use a "jump" address helper redirection service.
     This will work within a few minutes of your entering the key to an address book on the same site.
     Test it yourself first by entering
     http://stats.i2p/cgi-bin/jump.cgi?a=<i>something</i>.i2p or
     or http://i2host.i2p/cgi-bin/i2hostjump?<i>something</i>.i2p
     into your browser.
     Once it's working, then you can tell others to use it.
 <li>Some people check eepsite lists such as
     <a href="http://inproxy.tino.i2p/status.php">inproxy.tino.i2p/status.php</a> for new eepsites, so you may start getting
     a few visitors. But there are plenty of other ways to tell people. Here are a few ideas:
     <ul>
     <li>Post a message on the <a href="http://forum.i2p/viewforum.php?f=16">Eepsite announce forum</a>
         on <a href="http://forum.i2p/">forum.i2p</a>.
     <li>Tell people about it on the #i2p or #i2p-chat channels on IRC.
     <li>Put it in a new post on <a href="http://syndie.i2p2.de/">the new Syndie</a>.
     <li>Put it in <a href="http://ugha.i2p/EepsiteIndex">Ugha's Eepsite Index Wiki</a>
     </ul>
     Note that some sites recommend pasting in that really long destination key.
     You can if you want - but
     if you have successfully posted your key at an add-key service,
     tested it using a jump service, and waited 24 hours for the
     address book update to propagate to others, that shouldn't be necessary.
 <li>If you have any questions try IRC #i2p or the
     <a href="http://forum.i2p/viewforum.php?f=10">technical problems section</a> on
     <a href="http://forum.i2p/">forum.i2p</a>.
     Good luck and welcome to I2P!
 </ul>
