# Release checklist and process

## Two weeks before

- Review Google Play crash reports, fix any related issues


## One week before

- Announce string freeze on #i2p-dev
- Update local English po files: `ant poupdate-source`
- Review changes in English po files, fix up any necessary tagged strings in Java source
- Revert English po files with no actual changes (i.e. with line number changes only)
- Check in remaining English po files (and any files with changed strings)
- Push to Transifex: `tx push --use-git-timestamps -s`
- Make announcement on Transifex with checkin deadline

- GeoIP: db-ip.com update is usually first of the month, time accordingly
- installer/resources/makegeoip.sh
- git commit installer/resources/GeoLite2-Country.mmdb.gz

- BuildTime: Don't have to do this every release, but update the
  EARLIEST and EARLIEST_LONG values in core/java/src/net/i2p/time/BuildTime.java
  to the current date, more or less.(or use `ant bumpBuildTime`)

- Tickets: Check if any blocker or critical tickets for this release remain open;
  check for overlooked issues on Gitea, Github, i2pforum.i2p, and Reddit;
  get them fixed and closed, or reclassified.

- Initial review: Review the complete diff from the last release, fix any issues

- Trial Debian build: Run 'ant debcheckpatch' and fix any issues.
  Build and test a preliminary Debian build with 'ant debian' and fix any issues

- Javadoc test: 'ant javadoc'
  with a recent Oracle JDK (12+), and fix any issues.
  Oracle JDK will error on things that OpenJDK does not!

- Java 7 test: 'ant mavenCentral.deps' with a Java 8 Compiler, Java 7 bootclasspath
 in override.properties to ensure that Android will build correcly; fix any issues.
 Ensure that JAVA_HOME is unset.

- Verify CI is passing on both Gitea and Github


## A day or two before

1. Write the release announcement and push to Transifex:

  - Checkout i2p.newsxml branch
    - See README for setup
  - `./create_new_entry.sh`
    - Entry href should be the in-net link to the release blog post
  - `tx push --use-git-timestamps -s`
  - `git commit`

2. Write the draft blog post and push to Transifex:

  - Checkout i2p.www branch
  - Write draft release announcement - see i2p2www/blog/README for instructions
    - Top content should be the same as the news entry
  - `tx push --use-git-timestamps -s -r I2P.website_blog`
  - `git commit`

3. Make announcement on Transifex asking for news translation

4. Tickets: Check if any blocker or critical tickets for this release remain open;
   get them fixed and closed, or reclassified.

5. Update and check in blocklist-tor.txt with `maketorblocklist.sh`

6. Verify CI is passing on both Gitea and Github


## On release day

### Preparation

1. Ensure all translation updates are imported from Transifex

  - Look for newly translated languages and resources on Transifex
  - Add any new ones to .tx/config (use your own judgement on which to include
    based on minimum translated percentage)
  - `tx pull --use-git-timestamps`
  - `ant testscripts` to verify that all updated translations are valid
  - For any invalid that break the test, fix up the po file manually, or fix on
    tx and pull again, or (if new) comment out in .tx/config (add a comment why)
    and delete the po file.
    See instructions in .tx/config for fixing up getopt properties files.
  - `installer/resources/poupdate-man.sh` to generate new man page translations
    (requires po4a package)
  - `git add` for any new po files
  - `git commit` all changed po files, and .tx/config if changed

2. Sync with git.idk.i2p

3. Start with a clean checkout:

    ```
    git clone -l . /path/to/releasedir
    ```

  - You must build with Java 8 or higher.

4. Create override.properties with (adjust as necessary):

    ```
    release.privkey.su3=/path/to/su3keystore.ks
    release.gpg.keyid=0xnnnnnnnn
    release.signer.su3=xxx@mail.i2p
    build.built-by=xxx
    javac.compilerargs=-bootclasspath /usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/rt.jar:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/jre/lib/jce.jar
    ```

5. Verify that no untrusted revisions were included:

    ```
    ant revisions
    ```

6. Review the complete diff from the last release:

    ```
    git diff i2p-2.(xx-1).0..HEAD > out.diff
    vi out.diff
    ```

7. Change revision in:
  - `history.txt`
  - `installer/install.xml`
  - `installer/install5.xml`
  - `core/java/src/net/i2p/CoreVersion.java`
    - (both VERSION and PUBLISHED_VERSION)
  - `router/java/src/net/i2p/router/RouterVersion.java`
    - (change to BUILD = 0 and EXTRA = "" and QUALIFIER = "")

8. `git commit`


### Build and test

0. Make sure you're using the right JDK
   `echo $JAVA_HOME` and `java -version`

1.  Build the release.
  - Decide if you want to include GeoIP or not.
    If it's been a few months since it was last included,
    use releaseWithGeoIPRepack. Otherwise, use releaseRepack.
    Use releaseWithJbigiRepack only if jbigi binaries were updated.
  - `ant releaseRepack` or `ant releaseWithGeoIPRepack` or `ant releaseWithJbigiRepack`
  - Copy i2pinstall_${release.number}_windows.exe,
    console.ico, ../lib/izpack/rh.bat, and ../lib/izpack/VersionInfo_template.rc
    to Windows machine
  - Edit rh.bat to set the correct version number
  - Run rh.bat to edit the resources
  - Sign the windows installer:
    Open Visual Studio developer prompt
    signtool sign /a /debug /fd SHA256 i2pinstall_${release.number}_windows.exe
  - GPG sign the signed windows installer: gpg -u keyid -b i2pinstall_${release.number}_windows.exe
  - sha256sum i2pinstall_${release.number}_windows.exe

2. Now test:
  - Save the output about checksums, sizes, and torrents to a file
    (traditionally `shasums.txt`)
    - (edit timestamps to UTC if you care)
  - Copy all the release files somewhere, make sure you have the same ones as last release
  - Verify sha256sums for release files
  - Check file sizes vs. previous release, shouldn't be smaller
    - If the update includes GeoIP, it will be about 1MB bigger
  - Unzip or list files from `i2pupdate.zip`, see if it looks right
  - For either windows or linux installer: (probably should do both the first time)
    - Rename any existing config dir (e.g. mv .i2p .i2p-save)
    - Run installer, install to temp dir
    - Look in temp dir, see if all the files are there
    - Unplug ethernet / turn off wifi so RI doesn't leak
    - `i2prouter start`
    - Verify release number in console
    - Verify welcome news
    - Click through all the app, status, eepsite, and config pages, see if they look right
    - Click through each of the translations, see if /console looks right
    - Look for errors in /log (other than can't reseed errors)
    - Look in config dir, see if all the files are there
    - Shutdown
    - Delete config dir
    - Move saved config dir back
    - Reconnect ethernet / turn wifi back on
  - Load torrents in i2psnark on your production router, verify infohashes

3. If all goes well, tag and push the release:

    ```
    git tag -s i2p-2.x.x
    git push
    git push origin tag i2p-2.x.x
    ```

    Ensure the release revision AND tag are pushed from Gitea to Github.

  - Add magnet links, change release dates and release number in to old-format
    news.xml, and distribute to news hosts (no longer necessary)
