i2prouter\-nowrapper \- start the I2P router

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBi2prouter\-nowrapper\fP

.SH DESCRIPTION
Start the I2P router, without the service wrapper.  This means the router
will not restart if it crashes.  Also, it will use the default memory size,
which may not be enough for I2P.
.P
You should really use the \fBi2prouter\fP(1)  script instead.  There are no
options.  To stop the router, use your browser to access
.UR http://localhost:7657/
the router console
.UE .

.UR https://i2pgit.org/i2p\-hackers/i2p.i2p/\-/issues
the I2P GitLab server
