Execute the build.sh script to produce jbigi library files optimized for a number of different CPU-types.

TODO: Instructions for adding the libraries to a jar

Linux-specific information:
Some linux distributions comes bundled with GMP. There is currently no out-of-the-box support for this in the current build-scripts.

Windows-specific information:
The best way of building the jbigi dll's is to install Mingw {URL} and msys {URL}. The combination of these two should be able to run the included build-scripts without modifications.
