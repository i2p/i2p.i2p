***net.i2p.util.NativeBigInteger, native part of the code****

See ../README for instructions.

Execute the build.sh script to produce jbigi library files optimized for a number of different CPU-types.

Linux-specific information:
===========================
Some linux distributions comes bundled with GMP.
Try 'locate lib/libgmp.so' to see.
If so, install the the libgmp3-dev debian package to get the libgmp headers.
Then export I2P=/path/to/your/i2p/install.
Then do 'build.sh dynamic'. This will do a quick build using your installed libgmp library
and then test it and the jbigi in your I2P installation to see which is faster.

If the new jbigi is slower, then run 'build.sh' (without the 'dynamic'), which will download
the libgmp library, build, and test that.


Windows-specific information:
=============================
The best way of building the jbigi dll's is to install Mingw {URL} and msys {URL}.
The combination of these two should be able to run the included build-scripts without modifications.
