<p>Implements the base I2P SDK for developing applications that communicate 
through I2P.</p>

<p>When a client application wants to communicate over I2P, the first thing it 
needs to do is get a {@link net.i2p.client.I2PClient} from the 
{@link net.i2p.client.I2PClientFactory}.  If it does not already have a {@link 
net.i2p.data.Destination}, it must generate one with the {@link 
net.i2p.client.I2PClient#createDestination} before proceeding.  Once it has
one, it then creates an {@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession} which serves as the
bridge to the I2P network, allowing it to send messages (via 
{@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession#sendMessage}) and receive messages (via 
{@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession#receiveMessage}).  In addition, the client 
receives asynchronous notification of network activity by providing an implementation 
of {@link net.i2p.client.I2PSessionListener}. </p>

<p>A simple example of how these base client classes can be used is the 
ATalk application.  It isn't really useful, but it is 
heavily documented code.</p>

<p>This client package provides the basic necessity for communicating over I2P,
but there are three other subpackages that are helpful.  Specifically:</p><ul>
<li>{@link net.i2p.client.datagram} - for applications that want their messages
    to be both authenticated and repliable</li>
<li>{@link net.i2p.client.naming} - for applications that want to resolve 
    readable names into {@link net.i2p.data.Destination}s</li>
<li>{@link net.i2p.client.streaming} - for applications that want to use 
    a streaming API to provide reliable in order message delivery (<b>note</b>:
    the streaming library is packaged seperate from the main SDK - in the 
    mstreaming.jar and streaming.jar)</li>
</ul>

<p>The {@link net.i2p.client.I2PSession} implementation itself communicates with
the I2P router by the I2CP (the client protocol).</p>
