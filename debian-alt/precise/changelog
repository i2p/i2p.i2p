i2p (0.9.8.1-1deb1) stable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 0.9.8.1. Initially I was not going to build 0.9.8.1
    packages since 0.9.8.1 was a Windows-only point release but I thought it
    would be good to have it in Tails. At the same time we may as well
    cherry-pick some easy bugfixes/updates from mtn.
  * debian/rules: Set the builddistribution specific versions
  * use xz for the 'debian' quilt 3.0 tarball
  * Cherry-picked fixes/updates:
    - Allow webapps.config to be preseeded by distributions
    - IPv6:
      + GeoIPv6 fixes (ticket #1096)
      + Add IPv6 NetDB categories
      + Mark IPv6-only as experimental
    - I2PSnark:
      + Start torrent by default
      + Fix start and start-all buttons on text browsers and Opera
        (ticket #1093)
    - I2PTunnel:
      + Post limiter
      + Persistent keying for SOCKS tunnels (ticket #1088)

  * Since I'm packaging the missing geoip information, I use an updated
    geoiodb from tor (taken from Debian package tor-geoipdb version

  * Patching countries.txt to add entries that are in Maxmind's database.
  * Now using debconf to ask about running as a daemon.
