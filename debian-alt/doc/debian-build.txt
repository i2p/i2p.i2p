To build a release:

Make sure workspace revision matches what you want to release.

# Make the source tarball
# only if you didn't already do it for launchpad!
# Otherwise make sure the i2p-1.xx.0.orig.tar.bz2 file is
# in the dir above the source directory, and skip to next step
ant debian-release-tarball

# Following instructions (and filenames) are for unstable.
# Repeat for each target.

# Go to the source directory created by ant debian-release-tarball
# Fix up the changelog
cd i2p_1.xx.0-x-xxxxxxxx/
ant debchange
vi debian/changelog
   change i2p_1.xx.0-x-xxxxxxxx-1 to i2p_1.xx.0-1
   change UNRELEASED to stable
   change comment to "New upstream version 1.xx.0"
   fix your name and email
# fix up the control and rules files as necessary
# fix up the patches/ files as necessary

# build the binary packages:
ant debian-binary
This will make the following files in .:
  i2p-doc_1.xx.0-1_all.deb
  i2p-router_1.xx.0-1_all.deb
  i2p_1.xx.0-1_all.deb
  libjbigi-jni_1.xx.0-1_amd64.deb
Note that you won't have a libjbigi-jni_1.xx.0-1_i386.deb file,
or one for any other architecture. Oh well.

# copy up so they don't get deleted
cp *.deb ..
# remove symlink (fixme?)
rm apps/susidns/src/lib/standard.jar

# build the source package, which will be in ..
# do gpg --list-keys to find your subkey id
debuild -S -sa -kYOURSUBKEYID
  (note: no space allowed in -kkeyid)
This will make the following files in ..:
  i2p_1.xx.0-1.dsc            (the GPG signature)
  i2p_1.xx.0-1.debian.tar.xz  (basically the debian/ directory tarball)
  i2p_1.xx.0-1_source.changes (the changelog text file)
# now do the same for jessie and wheezy and precise (NO, don't, we will copy below)

# scp the following files to the reprepro server:
  i2p_1.xx.0-1.dsc            (the GPG signature)
  i2p_1.xx.0-1.tar.xz  (basically the debian/ directory tarball)
  i2p_1.xx.0-1_source.changes (the changelog text file)
  i2p_1.xx.0.orig.tar.bz2            (the source tarball)
  i2p-doc_1.xx.0-1_all.deb           (docs)
  i2p-router_1.xx.0-1_all.deb        (binary)
  i2p_1.xx.0-1_all.deb               (top-level package)
  libjbigi-jni_1.xx.0-1_amd64.deb    (binary)
