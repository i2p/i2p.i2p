Instructions to upload to launchpad PPA

You must have a GPG key already uploaded to the
usual public key servers, where launchpad can find it.

Overview
--------

We currently copy the launchpad builds to our debian repo both
for use in both the ubuntu and debian distros. This is much easier
than doing debian builds ourselves.

Versions are as follows:

Min version	Max version		Uses src pkg	Copied to Debian	Notes
-----------	-----------		------------	----------------	-----
resolute				resolute	trixie, sid		ant debian-release-tarball
questing				jammy					Don't bother to build, use jammy
jammy		noble			jammy		bullseye, bookworm	ant jammy-release-tarball

Unsupported (No Java 17):
bionic		--			bionic		--
focal		--			bionic		--

Unsupported (Java 7):
precise		saucy   		precise		wheezy
trusty		wily			precise		jessie, stretch

Unsupported (ant < 1.9.8)
xenial		yakkety			xenial		--





Prep (first time only)
----------------------

- Make a launchpad account
- Log into launchpad
- Get your GPG fingerprint (gpg -K --fingerprint)
- Add your GPG fingerprint at the form on
  https://launchpad.net/~/+editpgpkeys
- Wait for the encrypted email response
- Decrypt and click the confirmation link in the email
- Click confirm on the page
- Make a PPA, lets call it 'test'
- OPTIONAL: Go to i2p.packages PPA and copy over existing I2P to your PPA:
  (select "copy existing binaries")
    jammy and higher

- you need the following packages
  sudo apt-get install devscripts dput dh_systemd bash-completion


Generate files to upload
------------------------

- check out clean copy of release:
  git clone -l . /path/to/releasedir

- export TZ=UTC
- cd i2p.i2p.foobar
- copy debian-alt/(series)/* to debian/
- edit debian/changelog to add the release at the top
  * series MUST be resolute
  * version MUST be 2.xx.0-1ubuntu1 for resolute
    For jammy, the names are different.
    next version for fixes would be 2.xx.0-2ubunutu1
  * name and email MUST EXACTLY match what's in your GPG keyring
    or the signing will fail.
    (or add -kkeyid argument to debuild, which you must do
     if you want to sign with a subkey. As of recent versions,
     the keyid argument must be a 16-char fingerprint, not a short key.)
    run gpg -K to list your private keys
- Remove patch files in debian/patches that are not listed in debian/patches/series
- ant debian-release-tarball (this is currently for resolute and higher)
  this will make a directory ../i2p-2.xx.0-0-xxxxxxxx/
  and a tarball ../i2p_2.xx.0.orig.tar.bz2
- cp debian/changelog ../i2p-2.xx.0-0-xxxxxxxx/debian/
- cp debian-alt/(series)/(other files besides changelog) to ../i2p-2.xx.0-0-xxxxxxxx/debian/
- cd ../i2p-2.xx.0-0-xxxxxxxx/
- Build the *1ubuntu1* files:
  If you have NOT done a successful dput for this release yet:
    debuild -S -sa -kkeyid
  otherwise, if just fixing up the control files, patches, etc:
    debuild -S -sd -kkeyid
  (note: no space allowed in -kkeyid)
  If you get a dpkg-checkbuilddeps error for jammy,
  add a -d option, e.g. debuild -d -S -sa -kkeyid
- If patches fail, you must fix them up, either manually or with quilt
  (quilt instructions go here)

- You will now have the following files in ..:
  i2p_2.xx.0-1ubuntu1.debian.tar.xz
  i2p_2.xx.0-1ubuntu1.dsc
  i2p_2.xx.0-1ubuntu1_source.changes
  i2p_2.xx.0-1ubuntu1_source.build
- And from the copy above:
  i2p_2.xx.0.orig.tar.bz2

Upload to launchpad
-------------------

- cd ..
- Upload to launchpad:
  dput ppa:your-lp-id/your-ppa-name i2p_2.xx.0-1ubuntu1_source.changes

This will upload the following files:
  i2p_2.xx.0-1ubuntu1.dsc            (the GPG signature)
  i2p_2.xx.0-1ubuntu1.debian.tar.xz  (basically the debian/ directory tarball)
  i2p_2.xx.0-1ubuntu1_source.changes (the changelog text file)
  i2p_2.xx.0.orig.tar.bz2            (the source tarball)

Note: If you didn't add your GPG fingerprint to your launchpad account
way up there above in step 2 or so, the upload will work,
but you will get no email back, and it will never build or show up on
the pending-build page.

Wait for it to build and be published.
Could be minutes to hours.

The amd64 build produces one deb:
   libjbigi-jni (amd64)
The i386 build produces three debs:
   i2p-doc (arch-independent), i2p-router (arch-independent), and libjbigi-jni (i386)
So the build isn't done until both arch builds are complete.
Don't do anything else until both builds are done and published.

If it works, copy the series you are running (e.g. yakkety) in your PPA
so that you can test.
  (select "copy existing binaries")
  Wait a few minutes for that to happen

Test
----

Add your PPA following the instructions at http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/download/debian:
     sudo apt-add-repository ppa:your-lp-id/your-ppa-name
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install i2p
     mv ~/.i2p ~/.i2p-save
     i2prouter start
     (test...)
     stop router
     sudo dpkg-reconfigure i2p
     (reconfigure as a service)
     (i2p should start as a service. test...)


Release
-------

Then copy from your PPA to the i2p-maintainers PPA.
Then in the i2p-maintainers PPA, copy to other versions as specified in the table
at the top of this document.
Did a new series open up since the last time you did this? Copy to the new one also.
  (select "copy existing binaries")


Creating milestone, release, and uploading files
----------------------------------------------

You may do this either before or after doing the Launchpad builds.

You must first create a milestone, then create a release
and attach it to the milestone.

(Enable referer sending in your browser if necessary)

Go to https://launchpad.net/i2p/trunk
Down at bottom, click 'create milestone'
    Name: 2.xx.0 (NOT i2p 2.xx.0)
    Code name: empty
    Date targeted: Actual release date
    Tags: empty
    Summary: empty
Click 'create milestone'
Now you are back on https://launchpad.net/i2p/trunk
At your milestone, 'release now'
    Date released: Actual release date
    Release notes: empty
    Changelog: empty
Click 'create release'
Now you are on the page for that milestone
Click 'add download file'
