Instructions to upload to launchpad PPA

You must have a GPG key already uploaded to the
usual public key servers, where launchpad can find it.

Overview
--------

We currently copy the launchpad builds to our debian repo both
for use in both the ubuntu and debian distros. This is much easier
than doing debian builds ourselves.

Versions are as follows:

Min version	Max version	Uses src pkg	Copied to Debian
-----------	-----------	------------	----------------
precise		saucy   	precise		wheezy
trusty		wily		precise		jessie
xenial		yakkety		xenial		--
artful		bionic		artful		stretch, buster, sid


Prep
----

- Make a launchpad account
- Log into launchpad
- Get your GPG fingerprint (gpg -K --fingerprint)
- Add your GPG fingerprint at the form on
  https://launchpad.net/~/+editpgpkeys
- Wait for the encrypted email response
- Decrypt and click the confirmation link in the email
- Click confirm on the page
- Make a PPA, lets call it 'test'
- OPTIONAL: Go to i2p.packages PPA and copy over existing I2P to your PPA:
  (select "copy existing binaries")
    trusty, xenial, artful
    not precise (only if building for precise which you probably aren't)
    not utopic (obsolete, disabled by launchpad)
- Go to i2p.packages PPA and copy over service-wrapper-java to your PPA.
  This is required for the build.
  (select "copy existing binaries")
    trusty
    not precise (only if building for precise which you probably aren't)
    not xenial, artful (more recent versions 3.5.25-2 or 3.5.26-3 are in official launchpad)
    not utopic (obsolete, disabled by launchpad)

- you need the following packages
  sudo apt-get install devscripts dput dh_systemd bash-completion

- check out clean copy of release:
  mtn co -d i2p.mtn -b i2p.i2p i2p.i2p.foobar -r t:i2p-0.9.xx

Generate files to upload
------------------------

- export TZ=UTC
- cd i2p.i2p.foobar
- copy debian-alt/(series)/changelog to debian/
- edit debian/changelog to add the release at the top
  * version MUST be 0.9.XX-1ubuntu1
    next version for fixes would be 0.9.XX-2ubunutu1
  * series MUST be xenial or trusty or precise
  * name and email MUST EXACTLY match what's in your GPG keyring
    or the signing will fail.
    (or add -kkeyid argument to debuild, which you must do
     if you want to sign with a subkey)
    run gpg -K to list your private keys
- ant debian-release-tarball (this is currently for artful and higher)
  (ant precise-release-tarball for precise thru wily... only do this once for both the precise and trusty build)
  (ant xenial-release-tarball for xenial and yakkety)
  this will make a directory ../i2p-0.9.XX-0-xxxxxxxx/
  and a tarball ../i2p_0.9.XX.orig.tar.bz2
- cp debian/changelog ../i2p-0.9.XX-0-xxxxxxxx/debian/
- cp debian-alt/(series)/(other files besides changelog) to ../i2p-0.9.XX-0-xxxxxxxx/debian/
- cd ../i2p-0.9.XX-0-xxxxxxxx/
- Note: If building for precise/trusty and you are on yakkety or higher without Java 7,
  make a symlink so debuild will work: cd /var/lib/jvm; sudo ln -s java-8-openjdk-amd64/ java-7-openjdk-amd64
- Build the *1ubuntu1* files:
  If you have NOT done a successful dput for this release yet:
    debuild -S -sa -kkeyid
  otherwise, if just fixing up the control files, patches, etc:
    debuild -S -sd -kkeyid
  (note: no space allowed in -kkeyid)
  If you get a dpkg-checkbuilddeps error for precise/trusty/xenial,
  add a -d option, e.g. debuild -d -S -sa -kkeyid
- If patches fail, you must fix them up, either manually or with quilt
  (quilt instructions go here)

- You will now have the following files in ..:
  i2p_0.9.XX-1ubuntu1.debian.tar.xz
  i2p_0.9.XX-1ubuntu1.dsc
  i2p_0.9.XX-1ubuntu1_source.changes
  i2p_0.9.XX-1ubuntu1_source.build
- And from the copy above:
  i2p_0.9.XX.orig.tar.bz2

Upload to launchpad
-------------------

- cd ..
- Upload to launchpad:
  dput ppa:your-lp-id/your-ppa-name i2p_0.9.XX-1ubuntu1_source.changes

This will upload the following files:
  i2p_0.9.XX-1ubuntu1.dsc            (the GPG signature)
  i2p_0.9.XX-1ubuntu1.debian.tar.xz  (basically the debian/ directory tarball)
  i2p_0.9.XX-1ubuntu1_source.changes (the changelog text file)
  i2p_0.9.XX.orig.tar.bz2            (the source tarball)

Note: If you didn't add your GPG fingerprint to your launchpad account
way up there above in step 2 or so, the upload will work,
but you will get no email back, and it will never build or show up on
the pending-build page.

Wait for it to build and be published.
Could be minutes to hours.

The amd64 build produces one deb:
   libjbigi-jni (amd64)
The i386 build produces three debs:
   i2p-doc (arch-independent), i2p-router (arch-independent), and libjbigi-jni (i386)
So the build isn't done until both arch builds are complete.
Don't


If it works, copy the series you are running (e.g. yakkety) in your PPA
so that you can test.
  (select "copy existing binaries")
  Wait a few minutes for that to happen

Test
----

Add your PPA following the instructions at http://i2p-projekt.i2p/en/download/debian:
     sudo apt-add-repository ppa:your-lp-id/your-ppa-name
     sudo apt-get update
     sudo apt-get install i2p
     mv ~/.i2p ~/.i2p-save
     i2prouter start
     (test...)
     stop router
     sudo dpkg-reconfigure i2p
     (reconfigure as a service)
     (i2p should start as a service. test...)


Release
-------

Then copy from your PPA to the i2p-maintainers PPA.
Then in the i2p-maintainers PPA, copy artful to bionic.
Did a new series open up since the last time you did this? Copy to the new one also.
  (select "copy existing binaries")
  Copy xenial first and wait for it to be published in i2p-maintainers or the others will fail.
For xenial, build and copy it separately. It is built from the "ant xenial-release-tarball" source.
For precise and trusty, build and copy it separately. Both precise and trusty are built
from the "ant precise-release-tarball" source.


Creating milestone, release, and uploading files
----------------------------------------------

You must first create a milestone, then create a release
and attach it to the milestone.
