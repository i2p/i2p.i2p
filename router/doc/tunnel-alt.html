<h2>1) <a name="tunnel.overview">Tunnel overview</a></h2>

<p>Within I2P, messages are passed in one direction through a virtual
tunnel of peers, using whatever means are available to pass the 
message on to the next hop.  Messages arrive at the tunnel's 
gateway, get bundled up and/or fragmented into fixed sizes tunnel messages, 
and are forwarded on to the next hop in the tunnel, which processes and verifies
the validity of the message and sends it on to the next hop, and so on, until
it reaches the tunnel endpoint.  That endpoint takes the messages
bundled up by the gateway and forwards them as instructed - either
to another router, to another tunnel on another router, or locally.</p>

<p>Tunnels all work the same, but can be segmented into two different
groups - inbound tunnels and outbound tunnels.  The inbound tunnels
have an untrusted gateway which passes messages down towards the 
tunnel creator, which serves as the tunnel endpoint.  For outbound 
tunnels, the tunnel creator serves as the gateway, passing messages
out to the remote endpoint.</p>

<p>The tunnel's creator selects exactly which peers will participate
in the tunnel, and provides each with the necessary configuration
data.  They may have any number of hops, but may be constrained with various
proof-of-work requests to add on additional steps.  It is the intent to make
it hard for either participants or third parties to determine the length of 
a tunnel, or even for colluding participants to determine whether they are a
part of the same tunnel at all (barring the situation where colluding peers are
next to each other in the tunnel).  A pair of synchronized PRNGs are used at 
each hop in the tunnel to validate incoming messages and prevent abuse through
loops.</p>

<p>Beyond their length, there are additional configurable parameters
for each tunnel that can be used, such as a throttle on the frequency of 
messages delivered, how padding should be used, how long a tunnel should be 
in operation, whether to inject chaff messages, and what, if any, batching
strategies should be employed.</p>

<p>In practice, a series of tunnel pools are used for different
purposes - each local client destination has its own set of inbound
tunnels and outbound tunnels, configured to meet its anonymity and
performance needs.  In addition, the router itself maintains a series
of pools for participating in the network database and for managing
the tunnels themselves.</p>

<p>I2P is an inherently packet switched network, even with these 
tunnels, allowing it to take advantage of multiple tunnels running 
in parallel, increasing resilience and balancing load.  Outside of
the core I2P layer, there is an optional end to end streaming library 
available for client applications, exposing TCP-esque operation,
including message reordering, retransmission, congestion control, etc.</p>

<h2>2) <a name="tunnel.operation">Tunnel operation</a></h2>

<p>Tunnel operation has four distinct processes, taken on by various 
peers in the tunnel.  First, the tunnel gateway accumulates a number
of tunnel messages and preprocesses them into something for tunnel
delivery.  Next, that gateway encrypts that preprocessed data, then
forwards it to the first hop.  That peer, and subsequent tunnel 
participants, unwrap a layer of the encryption, verifying the 
integrity of the message, then forward it on to the next peer.  
Eventually, the message arrives at the endpoint where the messages
bundled by the gateway are split out again and forwarded on as 
requested.</p>

<p>Tunnel IDs are 4 byte numbers used at each hop - participants know what
tunnel ID to listen for messages with and what tunnel ID they should be forwarded
on as to the next hop.  Tunnels themselves are short lived (10 minutes at the 
moment), but depending upon the tunnel's purpose, and though subsequent tunnels 
may be built using the same sequence of peers, each hop's tunnel ID will change.</p>

<h3>2.1) <a name="tunnel.preprocessing">Message preprocessing</a></h3>

<p>When the gateway wants to deliver data through the tunnel, it first
gathers zero or more I2NP messages, selects how much padding will be used, 
fragments it across the necessary number of 1KB tunnel messages, and decides how
each I2NP message should be handled by the tunnel endpoint, encoding that
data into the raw tunnel payload:</p>
<ul>
<li>the first 4 bytes of the SHA256 of the remaining preprocessed data concatenated 
    with the preIV, using the preIV as will be seen on the tunnel endpoint (for
    outbound tunnels) or the preIV as was seen on the tunnel gateway (for inbound
    tunnels) (see below for preIV processing).</li>
<li>0 or more bytes containing random nonzero integers</li>
<li>1 byte containing 0x00</li>
<li>a series of zero or more { instructions, message } pairs</li>
</ul>

<p>The instructions are encoded as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>1 byte value:<pre>
   bits 0-1: delivery type
             (0x0 = LOCAL, 0x01 = TUNNEL, 0x02 = ROUTER)
      bit 2: delay included?  (1 = true, 0 = false)
      bit 3: fragmented?  (1 = true, 0 = false)
      bit 4: extended options?  (1 = true, 0 = false)
   bits 5-7: reserved</pre></li>
<li>if the delivery type was TUNNEL, a 4 byte tunnel ID</li>
<li>if the delivery type was TUNNEL or ROUTER, a 32 byte router hash</li>
<li>if the delay included flag is true, a 1 byte value:<pre>
      bit 0: type (0 = strict, 1 = randomized)
   bits 1-7: delay exponent (2^value minutes)</pre></li>
<li>if the fragmented flag is true, a 4 byte message ID, and a 1 byte value:<pre>
   bits 0-6: fragment number
      bit 7: is last?  (1 = true, 0 = false)</pre></li>
<li>if the extended options flag is true:<pre>
   = a 1 byte option size (in bytes)
   = that many bytes</pre></li>
<li>2 byte size of the I2NP message</li>
</ul>

<p>The I2NP message is encoded in its standard form, and the 
preprocessed payload must be padded to a multiple of 16 bytes.</p>

<h3>2.2) <a name="tunnel.gateway">Gateway processing</a></h3>

<p>After the preprocessing of messages into a padded payload, the gateway builds
a random 16 byte preIV value, iteratively encrypting it and the tunnel message as
necessary, selects the next message ID from its outbound PRNG, and forwards the tuple 
{tunnelID, messageID, preIV, encrypted tunnel message} to the next hop.</p>

<p>How encryption at the gateway is done depends on whether the tunnel is an
inbound or an outbound tunnel.  For inbound tunnels, they simply select a random
preIV, postprocessing and updating it to generate the IV for the gateway and using 
that IV along side their own layer key to encrypt the preprocessed data.  For outbound 
tunnels they must iteratively decrypt the (unencrypted) preIV and preprocessed 
data with the layer keys for all hops in the tunnel.  The result of the outbound
tunnel encryption is that when each peer encrypts it, the endpoint will recover 
the initial preprocessed data.</p>

<p>The preIV postprocessing should be a secure transform of the received value 
with sufficient expansion to provide the full 16 byte IV necessary for AES256.  
<i>What transform should be used - E(preIV, layerIVKey), where
we deliver an additional postprocessing layer key to each peer during the 
<a href="#tunnel.request">tunnel creation</a> to reduce the potential exposure
of the layerKey?</i></p>

<h3>2.3) <a name="tunnel.participant">Participant processing</a></h3>

<p>When a peer receives a tunnel message, it checks the inbound PRNG for that
tunnel, verifying that the message ID specified is one of the next available IDs,
thereby removing it from the PRNG and moving the window.  If the message ID is
not one of the available IDs, it is dropped.  The participant then postprocesses
and updates the preIV received to determine the current hop's IV, using that 
with the layer key to encrypt the tunnel message.  They then select the next 
selects the next message ID from its outbound PRNG, forwarding the tuple 
{nextTunnelID, nextMessageID, nextPreIV, encrypted tunnel message} to the next hop.</p>

<p>Each participant also maintains a bloom filter of preIV values used for the 
lifetime of the tunnel at their hop, allowing them to drop any messages with 
duplicate preIVs.  <i>The details of the hash functions used in the bloom filter
are not yet worked out.  Suggestions?</i></p>

<h3>2.4) <a name="tunnel.endpoint">Endpoint processing</a></h3>

<p>After receiving and validating a tunnel message at the last hop in the tunnel,
how the endpoint recovers the data encoded by the gateway depends upon whether 
the tunnel is an inbound or an outbound tunnel.  For outbound tunnels, the 
endpoint encrypts the message with its layer key just like any other participant, 
exposing the preprocessed data.  For inbound tunnels, the endpoint is also the 
tunnel creator so they can merely iteratively decrypt the preIV and message, using the 
layer keys of each step in reverse order.</p>

<p>At this point, the tunnel endpoint has the preprocessed data sent by the gateway,
which it may then parse out into the included I2NP messages and forwards them as
requested in their delivery instructions.</p>

<h3>2.5) <a name="tunnel.padding">Padding</a></h3>

<p>Several tunnel padding strategies are possible, each with their own merits:</p>

<ul>
<li>No padding</li>
<li>Padding to a random size</li>
<li>Padding to a fixed size</li>
<li>Padding to the closest KB</li>
<li>Padding to the closest exponential size (2^n bytes)</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Which to use?  no padding is most efficient, random padding is what
we have now, fixed size would either be an extreme waste or force us to
implement fragmentation.  Padding to the closest exponential size (ala freenet)
seems promising.  Perhaps we should gather some stats on the net as to what size
messages are, then see what costs and benefits would arise from different 
strategies?  <b>See <a href="http://dev.i2p.net/~jrandom/messageSizes/">gathered
stats</a></b></i></p>

<h3>2.6) <a name="tunnel.fragmentation">Tunnel fragmentation</a></h3>

<p>To prevent adversaries from tagging the messages along the path by adjusting
the message size, all tunnel messages are a fixed 1KB in size.  To accommodate 
larger I2NP messages as well as to support smaller ones more efficiently, the
gateway splits up the larger I2NP messages into fragments contained within each
tunnel message.  The endpoint will attempt to rebuild the I2NP message from the
fragments for a short period of time, but will discard them as necessary.</p>

<h3>2.7) <a name="tunnel.prng">PRNG pairs</a></h3>

<p>To minimize the damage from a DoS attack created by looped tunnels, a series
of synchronized PRNGs are used across the tunnel - the gateway has one, the 
endpoint has one, and every participant has two.  These in turn are broken down 
into the inbound and outbound PRNG for each tunnel - the outbound PRNG is 
synchronized with the inbound PRNG of the peer after you (obvious exception being
the endpoint, which has no peer after it).  Outside of the PRNG with which each
is synchronized with, there is no relationship between any of the other PRNGs.  
This is accomplished by using a common PRNG algorithm <i>[tbd, perhaps 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/util/Random.html">java.lang.random</a>?]</i>, 
seeded with the values delivered with the tunnel creation request.  Each peer 
prefetches the next few values out of the inbound PRNG so that it can handle 
lost or briefly out of order delivery, using these values to compare against the
received message IDs.</p>

<p>An adversary can still build loops within the tunnels, but the damage done is
minimized in two ways.  First, if there is a loop created by providing a later
hop with its next hop pointing at a previous peer, that loop will need to be 
seeded with the right value so that its PRNG stays synchronized with the previous
peer's inbound PRNG.  While some messages would go into the loop, as they start
to actually loop back, two things would happen.  Either they would be accepted
by that peer, thereby breaking the synchronization with the other PRNG which is
really "earlier" in the tunnel, or the messages would be rejected if the real
"earlier" peer sent enough messages into the loop to break the synchronization.</p>

<p>If the adversary is very well coordinated and is colluding with several 
participants, they could still build a functioning loop, though that loop would
expire when the tunnel does.  This still allows an expansion of their work factor
against the overall network load, but with tunnel throttling this could even
be a useful positive tool for mitigating active traffic analysis.</p>

<h3>2.8) <a name="tunnel.alternatives">Alternatives</a></h3>

<h4>2.8.1) <a name="tunnel.reroute">Adjust tunnel processing midstream</a></h4>

<p>While the simple tunnel routing algorithm should be sufficient for most cases,
there are three alternatives that can be explored:</p>
<ul>
<li>Have a peer other than the endpoint temporarily act as the termination 
point for a tunnel by adjusting the encryption used at the gateway to give them
the plaintext of the preprocessed I2NP messages.  Each peer could check to see 
whether they had the plaintext, processing the message when received as if they
did.</li>
<li>Allow routers participating in a tunnel to remix the message before 
forwarding it on - bouncing it through one of that peer's own outbound tunnels,
bearing instructions for delivery to the next hop.</li>
<li>Implement code for the tunnel creator to redefine a peer's "next hop" in
the tunnel, allowing further dynamic redirection.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2.8.2) <a name="tunnel.bidirectional">Use bidirectional tunnels</a></h4>

<p>The current strategy of using two separate tunnels for inbound and outbound
communication is not the only technique available, and it does have anonymity
implications.  On the positive side, by using separate tunnels it lessens the
traffic data exposed for analysis to participants in a tunnel - for instance,
peers in an outbound tunnel from a web browser would only see the traffic of
an HTTP GET, while the peers in an inbound tunnel would see the payload 
delivered along the tunnel.  With bidirectional tunnels, all participants would
have access to the fact that e.g. 1KB was sent in one direction, then 100KB
in the other.  On the negative side, using unidirectional tunnels means that
there are two sets of peers which need to be profiled and accounted for, and
additional care must be taken to address the increased speed of predecessor
attacks.  The tunnel pooling and building process outlined below should
minimize the worries of the predecessor attack, though if it were desired,
it wouldn't be much trouble to build both the inbound and outbound tunnels
along the same peers.</p>

<h2>3) <a name="tunnel.building">Tunnel building</a></h2>

<p>When building a tunnel, the creator must send a request with the necessary
configuration data to each of the hops, then wait for the potential participant
to reply stating that they either agree or do not agree.  These tunnel request
messages and their replies are garlic wrapped so that only the router who knows
the key can decrypt it, and the path taken in both directions is tunnel routed
as well.  There are three important dimensions to keep in mind when producing
the tunnels: what peers are used (and where), how the requests are sent (and 
replies received), and how they are maintained.</p>

<h3>3.1) <a name="tunnel.peerselection">Peer selection</a></h3>

<p>Beyond the two types of tunnels - inbound and outbound - there are two styles
of peer selection used for different tunnels - exploratory and client.
Exploratory tunnels are used for both network database maintenance and tunnel
maintenance, while client tunnels are used for end to end client messages.  </p>

<h4>3.1.1) <a name="tunnel.selection.exploratory">Exploratory tunnel peer selection</a></h4>

<p>Exploratory tunnels are built out of a random selection of peers from a subset
of the network.  The particular subset varies on the local router and on what their
tunnel routing needs are.  In general, the exploratory tunnels are built out of
randomly selected peers who are in the peer's "not failing but active" profile
category.  The secondary purpose of the tunnels, beyond merely tunnel routing,
is to find underutilized high capacity peers so that they can be promoted for
use in client tunnels.</p>

<h4>3.1.2) <a name="tunnel.selection.client">Client tunnel peer selection</a></h4>

<p>Client tunnels are built with a more stringent set of requirements - the local
router will select peers out of its "fast and high capacity" profile category so
that performance and reliability will meet the needs of the client application.
However, there are several important details beyond that basic selection that 
should be adhered to, depending upon the client's anonymity needs.</p>
  
<p>For some clients who are worried about adversaries mounting a predecessor 
attack, the tunnel selection can keep the peers selected in a strict order -
if A, B, and C are in a tunnel, the hop after A is always B, and the hop after
B is always C.  A less strict ordering is also possible, assuring that while
the hop after A may be B, B may never be before A.  Other configuration options
include the ability for just the inbound tunnel gateways and outbound tunnel
endpoints to be fixed, or rotated on an MTBF rate.</p>

<h3>3.2) <a name="tunnel.request">Request delivery</a></h3>

<p>As mentioned above, once the tunnel creator knows what peers should go into
a tunnel and in what order, the creator builds a series of tunnel request 
messages, each containing the necessary information for that peer.  For instance,
participating tunnels will be given the 4 byte tunnel ID on which they are to
receive messages, the 4 byte tunnel ID on which they are to send out the messages,
the 32 byte hash of the next hop's identity, the pair of PRNG seeds for the inbound
and outbound PRNG, and the 32 byte layer key used to
remove a layer from the tunnel.  Of course, outbound tunnel endpoints are not 
given any "next hop" or "next tunnel ID" information, and neither the inbound 
tunnel gateways nor the outbound tunnel endpoints need both PRNG seeds.  To allow 
replies, the request contains a random session tag and a random session key with 
which the peer may garlic encrypt their decision, as well as the tunnel to which
that garlic should be sent.  In addition to the above information, various client
specific options may be included, such as what throttling to place on the tunnel,
what padding or batch strategies to use, etc.</p>

<p>After building all of the request messages, they are garlic wrapped for the
target router and sent out an exploratory tunnel.  Upon receipt, that peer 
determines whether they can or will participate, creating a reply message and
both garlic wrapping and tunnel routing the response with the supplied 
information.  Upon receipt of the reply at the tunnel creator, the tunnel is
considered valid on that hop (if accepted).  Once all peers have accepted, the
tunnel is active.</p>

<h3>3.3) <a name="tunnel.pooling">Pooling</a></h3>

<p>To allow efficient operation, the router maintains a series of tunnel pools,
each managing a group of tunnels used for a specific purpose with their own
configuration.  When a tunnel is needed for that purpose, the router selects one
out of the appropriate pool at random.  Overall, there are two exploratory tunnel
pools - one inbound and one outbound - each using the router's exploration 
defaults.  In addition, there is a pair of pools for each local destination -
one inbound and one outbound tunnel.  Those pools use the configuration specified
when the local destination connected to the router, or the router's defaults if
not specified.</p>

<p>Each pool has within its configuration a few key settings, defining how many
tunnels to keep active, how many backup tunnels to maintain in case of failure,
how frequently to test the tunnels, how long the tunnels should be, whether those
lengths should be randomized, how often replacement tunnels should be built, as 
well as any of the other settings allowed when configuring individual tunnels.</p>

<h3>3.4) <a name="tunnel.building.alternatives">Alternatives</a></h3>

<h4>3.4.1) <a name="tunnel.building.telescoping">Telescopic building</a></h4>

<p>One question that may arise regarding the use of the exploratory tunnels for
sending and receiving tunnel creation messages is how that impacts the tunnel's 
vulnerability to predecessor attacks.  While the endpoints and gateways of 
those tunnels will be randomly distributed across the network (perhaps even 
including the tunnel creator in that set), another alternative is to use the
tunnel pathways themselves to pass along the request and response, as is done
in <a href="http://tor.eff.org/">TOR</a>.  This, however, may lead to leaks 
during tunnel creation, allowing peers to discover how many hops there are later
on in the tunnel by monitoring the timing or packet count as the tunnel is
built.  Techniques could be used to minimize this issue, such as using each of 
the hops as endpoints (per <a href="#tunnel.reroute">2.7.2</a>) for a random
number of messages before continuing on to build the next hop.</p>

<h4>3.4.2) <a name="tunnel.building.nonexploratory">Non-exploratory tunnels for management</a></h4>

<p>A second alternative to the tunnel building process is to give the router 
an additional set of non-exploratory inbound and outbound pools, using those for
the tunnel request and response.  Assuming the router has a well integrated view
of the network, this should not be necessary, but if the router was partitioned
in some way, using non-exploratory pools for tunnel management would reduce the
leakage of information about what peers are in the router's partition.</p>

<h2>4) <a name="tunnel.throttling">Tunnel throttling</a></h2>

<p>Even though the tunnels within I2P bear a resemblance to a circuit switched
network, everything within I2P is strictly message based - tunnels are merely
accounting tricks to help organize the delivery of messages.  No assumptions are
made regarding reliability or ordering of messages, and retransmissions are left
to higher levels (e.g. I2P's client layer streaming library).  This allows I2P
to take advantage of throttling techniques available to both packet switched and
circuit switched networks.  For instance, each router may keep track of the 
moving average of how much data each tunnel is using, combine that with all of 
the averages used by other tunnels the router is participating in, and be able
to accept or reject additional tunnel participation requests based on its 
capacity and utilization.  On the other hand, each router can simply drop 
messages that are beyond its capacity, exploiting the research used on the 
normal internet.</p>

<h2>5) <a name="tunnel.mixing">Mixing/batching</a></h2>

<p>What strategies should be used at the gateway and at each hop for delaying,
reordering, rerouting, or padding messages?  To what extent should this be done
automatically, how much should be configured as a per tunnel or per hop setting,
and how should the tunnel's creator (and in turn, user) control this operation?
All of this is left as unknown, to be worked out for 
<a href="http://www.i2p.net/roadmap#3.0">I2P 3.0</a></p>
