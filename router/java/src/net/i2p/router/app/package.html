Interface for classes to be started and stopped via clients.config.
Classes implementing the RouterApp interface will be controlled with
the that interface instead of being started with main().
</p>
<p>
The benefits for clients using this interface:
<ul>
<li>Get the current context via the constructor
<li>Complete life cycle management by the router
<li>Avoid the need for static references
<li>Ability to find other clients without using static references
</ul>
